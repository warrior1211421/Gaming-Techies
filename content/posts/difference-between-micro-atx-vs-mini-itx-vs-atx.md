      your selection based on various factors such as size, power,
      compatibility, specifications, and much more. For example, the motherboard
      that you love might not support the architecture or generation of the
      processor, or it may be too large to fit in the PC case. For instance,
      motherboards are available in several size and form factors, and the
      motherboard selection shapes your selection of other PC components.
      Therefore, this article will discuss the difference between Micro ATX VS.
      Mini ITX VS. ATX to help you make an intelligent purchase.

  **The Dimensions:**

  **Mini ITX:** 170mm x 170mm or 6.7” x 6.7”

  **Micro ATX:** 244mm x 244mm or 9.6” x 9.6”

  **ATX:** 305mm x 244 mm or 12.0” x 9.6”


  As you can see, ATX is the largest form factor that you can get in a motherboard. It requires a larger PC case, and the parts that fit in the motherboard are also comparatively larger. Similarly, Micro ATX motherboards are slightly smaller, followed by Mini ITX motherboards. The form factor that you choose will dictate which PC parts can fit in it and which ones are out of bounds.

          ATX motherboards are the largest ones that you can buy from the
          market. The Advanced Technology eXtended or ATX motherboards provide
          more room to fit all your PC parts without blocking ventilation. For
          instance, an ATX motherboard has 4-slots of RAM that can support up to
          128GBs of memory without any problem. Moreover, you get space to
          install up to six HDDs or SSDs along with NVMe slots to extend the
          storage space. 


          Furthermore, most ATX motherboards support either Crossfire, SLI, or both technologies for a dual-GPU setup. Another reason to choose an ATX motherboard is that it supports heavy Power Supply Units to ensure that your system never runs out of resources, even if you choose to overclock the system. You can find several other useful features in an ATX motherboard that will enhance your gaming or working experience. However, ATX motherboards are comparatively more expensive than others as they offer a lot in terms of performance and features.
    pros:
      - pro: More RAM slots
      - pro: Better ventilation system
      - pro: More room for storage devices
      - pro: Dual GPU support
