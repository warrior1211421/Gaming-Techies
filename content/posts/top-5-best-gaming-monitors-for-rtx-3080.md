      The gaming industry has greatly evolved ever since the first game. The
      graphics are becoming more realistic, especially with 4K gaming support.

  Do you like the new RTX 3080? Chances are you will be upgrading pretty soon if
  you haven’t already. But you need a suitable monitor to unleash the true
  performance of this beast of a GPU. So what’s wrong with your current monitor?
  Everything! The graphics of the gaming industry have greatly changed,
  especially in the last few years.


  With major game titles coming up in 2022, everyone needs to re-evaluate their gaming system. Older monitors can only have a limited refresh rate, lower resolution with the trade off in viewing angles, and an ineffective pixel density. Another great thing about 2022 is the new Windows upgrade schedules for the mid-spring of the next year. This upgrade favors the gaming community. It will include a built-in HDR function to let you make use of graphics settings and enhance the graphics of all Windows games.


  Moreover, the new update will also allow android games to run on your system. So, it’s about time you upgrade your gaming rig for the future. Here is exactly what you should keep in mind at the same time when choosing a **monitor for RTX 3080**:


  ### Refresh Rate


  What’s the point of a higher game FPS if your monitor is incapable. According to GameTech, the new RTX 3080 can play Valorant with up to 200+ frames per second. Without a proper monitor refresh rate, all this capability becomes useless. Therefore, you need a monitor with a 120-240Hz refresh rate.


  It means that the display matches your current framerate per second and displays what’s happening in the game. Moreover, a higher refresh rate takes away most game lags due to the lower one. However, the ping and hardware optimization effect is still in place. 


  All the products in this list have a suitable refresh rate for Call of Duty, **[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/),** and PUBG. So, you will get an **[optimized gaming](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-optimize-mac-for-gaming/)** (optimize max for gaming) experience regardless of which product you choose. 


  ### Response Time


  The response time is another deciding factor for online shooter games. Do you ever feel like the cursor is not moving according to your mouse actions? This means that you need a monitor with impressive response time, not that older one with ultra low response time that.


  It is usually because most gaming mouses have a higher DPI, but the monitor’s response time doesn’t match such speed. As a result, your aim seems laggy no matter how much you increase or decrease the DPI. Moreover, the response time can also mess up your hours of video editing. The monitor doesn’t respond to your editing effects like hue, vignette, and motion blur in time, and you end up placing the effect in the wrong frame. 


  Therefore, you need a monitor with at least 0.8-1 ms response time. The quick response ensures that the display is available in real-time and not with a few ms delay. The low input lag will provide you with an unmatchable speed in the game as long as you can keep up with the refresh. Otherwise, you need some advice and hours of training to game effectively and eliminate all the enemies. 


  ### Resolution


  Did you know? The RTX 3080 can play most games like Assassin’s creed Valhalla, GTA V Online, and Call of Duty vanguard at 4K resolution. So, why not utilize such performance by playing the way it’s meant to be played. Most typical gaming monitors only have 1080P or 2K resolution, which is ineffective for viewing the highest quality graphics. So, you need a gaming monitor that displays accurate colors and true pixels as rendered by the GPU. Having at least a 2K or 4K resolution monitor is a must for every RTX 3080 owner out there.


  4K has become so normal that even YouTube has several videos in 4K. So, whether you want a monitor for gaming, working, or watching movies, 4K is a must-have for you. It would help to check the product specifications and physically test the hardware before actually purchasing a monitor for RTX 3080. 


  ### Adaptation


  All the graphics cards are either manufactured by Nvidia or AMD. Both the brands have their pros and cons; I won’t be talking about that for now. Nvidia graphics cards are optimized for the G-Sync adaptation. It provides a higher refresh rate, better performance and unlocks the Optimus technology of modern **[Nvidia GPUs](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Gpu/s?k=NVIDIA+Gpu&linkCode=ll2&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=ad4bd5e3c613ed132d7c7ca99a337b28&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).** Similarly, **[AMD Cards](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=amd+Gpu&linkCode=ll2&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=438f334cc0091e04037a5328d7a31eee&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** are optimized for the FreeSync physical module. It unlocks several premium features of the card and provides the advertised performance without **[overheating](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-keep-gpu-cool/)** (keep your GPU cool while gaming) or overclocking. 


  So, it would be best to choose the monitor according to your GPU. Most of the products in this list have both FreeSync and G sync compatibility modules. So, you can choose any product from above, and I assure you that your graphics card will work without any problems. For other users, I recommend that you check the product specifications and choose according to your gaming setup and experience the market’s best.

          When it comes to quality gaming, you are allowed to get picky. The
          best gaming session is only possible if the monitor matches your
          hardware. If you are in the market for the best option at hand, **[LG
          34GP83A-B](https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GP83A-B-Inch-Ultragear-Compatibility/dp/B08DWD38VX?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=de9908b4da5b74889029b75099166509&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is
          second to none.


          We all know the achievements of LG in terms of screen size and PPI. LG makes their screens, and LG phone screens speak for themselves. The LG 34GP83A-B offers unmatched pixel density and screen-to-body ratio.


          Moreover, the best thing about this ultrawide gaming monitor is that you can double it as your television screen. The 32-inch curved screen is more than enough for enjoying your movies in nothing less than **[Blu-Ray](https://www.blu-ray.com/)** quality.


          However, having only the best ultrawide gaming monitor doesn’t fulfill the need of modern-day competitive gamers. Besides a large gaming monitor, there are also other features that are needed, and this perfect gaming monitor comes with all.


          Similarly, this LG gaming is one of the best monitors for RTX 3080 graphics card that provide you unmatched HDR effect in the market. The soft yet bright screen offers the ultimate gaming experience that you are looking for. However, this monitor is not suitable for hardcore gamers who play multiplayer games at a fast pace. The screen only offers a 160Hz refresh rate that feels like up to 180Hz.


          The higher number of input ports, including USB 2.0 and 2 standard HDMI ports, allow you to have multiple connectivity options. For example, you can connect your gaming PC to one HDMI port and the TV box to the other. It even includes a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack for connecting theater speakers for the best gaming and home-theater experience possible.

          Gaming systems have to beat them all both visually and
          performance-wise. **[Samsung
          G7](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-27-inch-Odyssey-G7-Monitor/dp/B088HJ4VQK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=e18259892b9b6598ca0c92233d7a405e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is
          the latest gaming monitor that focuses on fast-paced shooter games.
          Therefore, if you want an Esports-like gaming experience, this product
          is the best one for you. It provides you with an exceptional Esports
          monitor-like feel.


          Both LG and Samsung are known for their high-quality displays. However, Samsung conquers the gaming world with its high-resolution monitors. Samsung Odyssey series is one of the world's first curved gaming monitors for professional gamers. When it comes to FPS gaming, you need to cash every feature that can help you in gaming. In this regard, G7 gaming monitor is probably the most feature-rich option for you.


          Most Shooter gamers complain that they die before even spotting the enemy. It is usually because the competitor probably has a higher refresh rate than yours-otherwise, it’s all about ping, response time, and your mouse DPI.


          Having a powerful gaming monitor like the Samsung G7 gives you the upper hand over others. Its fastest 1ms response time without compromising on viewing angles, its improved screen resolution and HDR support makes it high end gaming monitor in the gaming world. It comes with about 600 nits peak brightness and 95% DCI-P3 gamut coverage.


          The G-sync + FreeSync compatibility bends the odds in your way. G-sync is the signature technology for Nvidia graphic cards. Similarly, FreeSync is suitable for AMD GPUs. Having both these technologies in the monitor makes it universally compatible with your current GPU and future upgrades. Secondly, the high 109 PPi provides a higher pixel density and thus a richer display. The OLED experience is suitable for power-saving and separating the colored parts of the image from the dark ones.


          All in all, if your Samsung G7 provides more than enough performance for competitive gamers. Another benefit of choosing the Samsung G7 gaming monitor is its curved display. We all are familiar with the amazing edge technology in Samsung phones. They took it to the next level by providing a high-quality curved display. It provides a higher field of view.


          Increased screen space means you can keep your eye out for the enemy much effectively. In short, every aspect of the Samsung G7 favors multiplayer FPS games. However, if you want better graphics rather than a quick response time, this device is not the one for you.

          The problem with most high-end gaming monitors is they provide one
          thing but lack in others. However, this is not the case with
          the **[Gigabyte Aorus
          FI32U](https://www.amazon.com/AORUS-Monitor-Exclusive-3840x2160-Response/dp/B09885HV8C?dchild=1&keywords=Gigabyte+Aorus+FI32U&qid=1633966459&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=cdf09ed738c5670ec44cbbea6282b791&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).**
          It provides you quality features, and improved image quality combined
          with a 4K display resolution. Hence, it becomes one of the best
          monitors for RTX available in the gaming world that lets you enjoy
          better image quality.


          Gigabyte aims to break every stereotype in the gaming world. Whether it is premium motherboards at a reasonable price or a faster refresh rate with a higher resolution. Samsung and LG monitors are good for casual gamers. However, the picture quality alone is not good enough for modern games. In this regard, Gigabyte Aorus F132U is one of the few 144Hz monitors with a 4K display.


          It seems as if the Aorus FI32U is the soulmate of RTX 3080 and other similar graphics card. It comes with the well-known FreeSync adaptation that enhances your display experience. The frame refresh rate is of the F132U is higher than most 4K gaming devices. Moreover, it comes with a large number of input ports.


          People prefer gaming equipment because they provide the highest contrast ratio and gaming experience possible. It doesn’t mean that you can’t watch your favorite movies and documentaries on a gaming monitor. This gaming monitor comes with more than seven input ports for your various systems. For example, you can plug your gaming PC in one port, console in the other and the TV set in the HDMI input ports or a USB flash and still have room for more devices.


          If you are a casual gamer who enjoys both single-player campaigns and multiplayer games, you won’t find a device better than this one. It provides just enough refresh rate for your fast-paced games and the right tone, resolution, response time, and pixel density for offline games.


          Also, it has up to 400 nits peak brightness that lets you have brighter highlights in HDR and combats the glare that can negatively affect your game in a well-lit environment.

          You have probably heard about Asus if you belong to any gaming
          community. They mass-produce almost all gaming hardware, from GPUs to
          motherboards and even gaming monitors. All products belonging to the
          Republic of Gaming ROG are highly efficient and optimized for
          competitive gaming. **[ASUS ROG Swift
          PG279QM](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-PG279QM/dp/B08LCNWQWL?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=8afb7686e8d73f7e8ce70138e09b43de&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is
          the latest gaming monitor by Asus for all home-based gamers. 


          Asus is the sole conqueror of the gaming monitors when it comes to high refresh rates and enhanced picture quality. For instance, Gigabyte managed to provide a 144Hz monitor but still it isn't enough for Valorant and COD players. So, if you are into competitive gaming, I suggest that the 240Hz of Asus ROG is far more superior than the Gigabyte and Samsung monitors.


          The great thing about Asus monitors is that they provide richer colors than even the most expensive displays for playing games. Their products are readily available from all gaming stores. It is safe to say that no monitor store is complete without at least one Asus product in it. Asus Swift PG279QM is a direct competitor of the Samsung G7 monitor. It offers a similar response time, increased angle of view, best picture quality, high resolution, and a rich color tone. 


          All Asus Swift monitors for rtx come with a built-in HDR effect. The latest Windows 10 update utilizes this HDR feature to enhance the textures and graphics of any game. Another problem with most gaming monitors is that the screen becomes distorted when motion blur is set too high. As a result, most games become unplayable and unrealistic.


          However, Asus Swift is optimized for the motion blur effect as well. The quick response time, that this monitor offers, ensures that the blur effect is produced and ceased before you can notice. In short, Asus Swift PG279QM is the best gaming monitor for motion blur. 


          Asus Swift belongs to the list of a few monitors with a built-in sRGB color scheme. Even the competitor **[Samsung G7](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-27-inch-Odyssey-G7-Monitor/dp/B088HJ4VQK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=e18259892b9b6598ca0c92233d7a405e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** and several **[Gigabyte](https://www.amazon.com/AORUS-Monitor-Exclusive-3840x2160-Response/dp/B09885HV8C?dchild=1&keywords=Gigabyte+Aorus+FI32U&qid=1633966459&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=cdf09ed738c5670ec44cbbea6282b791&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** monitors don’t come with an sRGB feature. You can control the color scheme to match your taste using the Asus monitor software.


          The best thing about this monitor is its g sync options. It comes with Nvidia’s g sync implementation that eliminates screen tearing and provides up to 240Hz of refresh rate for an exceptional gaming experience.


          Nevertheless, this rate is variable. The variable refresh rate means that you can adjust it and the response time according to the game you are playing. For instance, you don’t need a faster speed in click games like AGE OF EMPIRES and **[DOTA 2](https://www.dota2.com/home)**. So, the higher refresh rate can mess your gameplay. Moreover, some games are not optimized for such a higher FPS monitor. In short, Asus Swift PG279QM provides the perfect tear-free gaming experience without adding to the purchase cost.
    pros:
      - pro: sRGB
      - pro: High pixel density
      - pro: 2K Resolution built-In HDR
      - pro: "Adjustable frame rate "

          Gone are the days of refresh rate vs. quality comparison. Previously,
          a higher refresh rate meant that you had to compromise on the picture
          quality. It means that you couldn’t enjoy the amazing graphics of
          modern AAA gaming. **[MSI Optix

          this stereotype by providing a high refresh rate along with a 2K
          resolution at an affordable price. 


          You can find tons of comparison reviews between Asus and MSI products. However, they both failed to provide the perfect budget gaming monitors. Until recently, MSI introduced their Optix monitors with a high RR, fully adjustable stand, and enhanced picture quality for the new Windows 11 HDR feature. In some cases, the Optix even beats Acer Predator gaming monitors. So, if you are low on budget, I suggest that you check this bad boy first.


          The gaming community is always debating about ROG or MSI devices. Both these brands provide unmatched performance, durability, and efficiency in different sectors of gaming. However, **[MSI](https://www.amazon.com/stores/MSIGaming/Homepage/page/4B9191C5-F3E7-4101-993F-ABD067C141BB?&linkCode=ll2&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=0e0086736ece3bd98910185a84400e4c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** got the upper hand with their new **gaming monitor optimized for the latest GPUs**. According to [**GameBible**,](https://www.gamingbible.co.uk/) you won’t need another monitor upgrade for at least three years if you buy MSI OPTIX. It means that this monitor is optimized for the past, present, and several future GPUs in the world. 


          Secondly, you need a separate monitor for your Workstation, especially if you are a professional streamer. People use apple products for video editing due to the endless possibilities and software stability. The problem is that Apple uses Type-C display ports instead of the typical HDMIs. Most monitors lack such an input port, thus forcing streamers to buy a separate monitor.


          However, MSI Optix is not one of those monitors. It has a built-in Type-C display port, an HDMI port, headphone jack a VGA port, and even a USB female port. However, it has low HDR peak brightness which sometimes makes its HDR content not different from SDR content.


          You can plug all your gaming and workstation systems into a single display. Moreover, the **MSI OPTIX** is optimized to connect **Windows PC, Mac** Workstation, and PlayStation console. You can choose the device of your personal preference by switching the current display channel. So, no need to get up from your seat just to switch your system.


          Some people like Linus use MSI Optix monitor for both gaming and working side-by-side. The advanced physical FreeSync and G sync compatibility modules detect your current hardware and adjust the settings automatically. In short, if you want an affordable **gaming monitor for RTX 3080**, MSI Optix is your best shot.
