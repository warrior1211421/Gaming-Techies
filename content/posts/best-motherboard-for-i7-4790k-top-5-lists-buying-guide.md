  Even if you know which motherboards suit your i7 4790K best, you must still
  have considered many things that make up a motherboard great in its existence.
  These things will help you know which motherboard should you buy and whether
  it will suit your processor or not.


  We consider the following things you must know about the motherboard you will buy for i7 4790K. 


  ### SATA Ports /SATA Connectors


  This is probably the first and most important thing you must consider while buying a motherboard. You must always look at how many SATA ports or SATA connectors the motherboard supports. In every buyer's guide SATA ports determine the connection quality for the storage devices you will have. 


  You must consider a compatible motherboard with all the SATA ports that support the connectivity for drives: including SSDs and others that you have already installed in your processor. 


  ### Form Factor


  The form factor is the thing that tells you how your motherboard is built. It involves all the specifications like shape, power supply, shape, size, mounting holes, and the overall layout. It would be best if you buy an **[ATX Form Factor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX)**


  ATX form factor allows more PCIe lanes and is best for multi GPU systems. Moreover, it can also accommodate greater RAM slots and help your system perform with greater efficiency, even while running high RAM-intensive applications. Similarly, if you plan a compact build, a micro ATX motherboard is best for you.


  ### PCI Slots


  This is another factor that we suggest you have a must look at in a motherboard. We suggest you consider a motherboard that comes with **[PCI slots](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8816/pci-slot)** to meet all your requirements easily. These ports are also known as more expansion slots and are commonly used to connect the expansion cards within the motherboard. 


  These expansion slots help your system to deliver efficient performance depending upon the type of your **[PC usage](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-reduce-cpu-usage-while-gaming/)**, including office work or gaming.


  ### Random Access Memory Slots 


  The next thing you will have to consider in a motherboard is the type and the number of memory slots it offers. We suggest you have a decent motherboard with a dual channel memory architecture to install 16 GB or more RAM to enjoy gaming and work on the same PC.


  Greater memory slots better the performance of your system, and hence the enhanced PC usage experience.


  Whether you enjoy spending your time playing games or doing some other heavy-duty work, your PC with greater RAM slots will be ever ready to handle everything.


  Not only will it improve your experience, but it will keep you at ease and feel fresh during all the time of your usage.


  ### Processor Socket 


  Then, you must also not ignore the Processor Socket in a motherboard. For Intel processors like i7 4790K, buying a motherboard with an **[LGA socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grid_array)** is the best choice. 


  So, these were some most important things that we suggest you consider in a motherboard. If you never ignore looking out for these things in the motherboard you are buying for your intel **core i7 4790K**, we bet that you are unlikely to go wrong with your decision.
