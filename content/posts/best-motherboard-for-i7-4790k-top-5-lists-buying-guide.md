  Even if you know which motherboards suit best your **i7 4790K**, you must
  still have considered a lot of things that make up a motherboard great in its
  existence. These things will help you know which motherboard should you
  actually buy and whether it will suit your processor or not.


  Following are some things that we consider you must know about the motherboard that you are going to buy for **i7 4790K**. 


  ### SATA Ports /SATA Connectors


  This is probably the first and most important thing that you must need to consider while buying a motherboard. You must always have a look at how many **[SATA ports](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-sata/)** or SATA connectors does the motherboard supports. The number of SATA port determine the quality of connection for the storage devices you will have. 


  You must consider a compatible motherboard that comes with all the SATA ports that support the connectivity for drives: including SSDs and others that you have already installed in your processor. 


  ### **Form Factor**


  Form factor is the thing which tells you how your motherboard is built. It involves all the specifications like shape, power supply, shape, size, mounting holes, and the overall layout. It would be best if you buy an **[ATX Form Factor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX)**


  ATX form factor allows you to have more PCIe lanes and are best for multi GPU systems. Moreover, it can accommodate greater RAM slots also and can help your system perform with greater efficiency, even while running high RAM-intensive applications.


  ### PCI Slots


  This is another factor that we suggest you have a must look at in a motherboard. We suggest you consider a motherboard that comes with **[PCI slots](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8816/pci-slot)** to meet all your requirements easily. These ports are also known as expansion slots and are commonly used to connect the expansion cards within the motherboard. 


  These expansion slots help your system to deliver efficient performance depending upon the type of your **[PC usage](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-reduce-cpu-usage-while-gaming/)**, including office work or gaming.


  ### Random Access Memory Slots 


  The next thing that you will have to consider in a motherboard is the type and also the number of memory slots that it offers. We suggest you have a motherboard that usually comes with **16 GB** or more RAM regardless of the type of processor you are using for your daily use. 


  Greater the memory slots better the performance of your system, and hence the enhanced PC usage experience.


  Whether you enjoy spending your time in playing games, or doing some other heavy duty work, your PC with greater RAM slots will be ever ready to handle everything.


  Not only will it improve your experience but will keep you at ease and feel fresh during all the time of your usage.


  ### Processor Socket 


  Then, you must also not ignore the Processor Socket in a motherboard. For Intel processors like **i7 4790K**, buying a motherboard with an **[LGA socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grid_array)** is the best choice. 


  So, these were some most important things that we suggest you to must consider in a motherboard. If you never ignore to look out for these things in the motherboard that you are buying for your **intel core i7 4790K**, we bet that you are unlikely to go wrong with your decision.
