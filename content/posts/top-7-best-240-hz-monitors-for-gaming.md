paragraphs:
  - paragraph: FPS is an important factor for most competitive gamers. Sometimes,
      the refresh rate even matters more than the resolution and picture
      quality. However, most people use a 60 Hz monitor and complain about game
      lags and coarse gameplay. As a result, they spend hundreds of dollars
      upgrading their gaming system specs, but all efforts go in vain. The main
      reason is that your monitor is the bottlenecking factor in this scenario.
  - paragraph: >-
      So, if you are a gaming enthusiast and want to upgrade your system, I
      suggest that you start with your monitor. In this regard, the best 240 Hz
      monitors seem suitable as they offer a higher refresh rate at a reasonable
      price.


      Furthermore, upgrading your monitor will positively impact your overall gaming experience. For instance, if you experience gaming issues like screen tearing, lagging, and blurring, a new monitor, is the only solution to your problem despite having a high-end gaming PC. Otherwise, it is just like watching a 4K resolution movie on a 2K display, i.e., inefficient.

          Samsung is best known for its highest grade displays in all its
          electronic gadgets. It is the reason why Samsung Android phones are
          rated as the best-display phones in the world. Moreover, the number 1
          smartphone seller, Apple, also buys its screens from Samsung. In other
          words, it won’t be wrong to say that Samsung is the crowned king of
          monitors and displays all over the world.


          When it comes to FPS gaming, you need a monitor that perfectly displays every frame in time so that you can take that one lucky shot. So, it is very important to cash every opportunity that you can avail yourself of when building a gaming PC. The most authentic gaming monitors give you that much-needed upper hand over your enemies in the field. 


          For instance, the 240 Hz refresh rate combined with the 1ms blazing fast response time gives you every opportunity to spot the enemy before he spots you. However, the need for a gaming monitor is not limited to multiplayer shooters only. You can play offline single-player games at full HD resolution without any lags. 


          Moreover, the higher display brightness is powered by the Samsung cutting edge OLED technology. It ensures that the bright spots show true colors while the dark spots remain unpowered. Thus, you will experience a perfect contrast ratio with crisper image quality, especially with the new Windows 11 HDR feature. In short, if you are looking for the perfect gaming monitor for your PC, I suggest that you check this one out.

      - pro: Several screen-sizes
      - pro: Supports both Nvidia and AMD for dual-GPUs
      - pro: Fewer Bezels
      - pro: Curved display

          Sometimes, just a gaming monitor isn’t good enough, especially if your
          whole room is an entertainment center. For instance, you may need to
          spend twice on displays, one for gaming and the other for watching
          movies and stuff. Well, what if there was a way to combine the two
          without losing the full HD resolution?


          Well, you are in luck because the Acer XB272 is by far the perfect all-in-one gaming display in the market. The monitor comes with enhanced eye protection and offers a flicker-less display. For instance, if you switch between multimedia and your gaming PC, you won’t experience any delay or brightness disturbance. Furthermore, the full HD resolution offers a very crisp picture quality that remains very close to 2K.


          Another benefit of buying this monitor is that you get access to all the features that you expect from a Television and a gaming monitor. For instance, the display comes with an HDMI port and a VGA display port. Moreover, you can also view your high-resolution media directly from a USB 3.0. Another great feature of this display is its two built-in speakers with active noise cancellation and a virtual surround. 


          The predator gaming monitor is truly a predator among its competitors. It is perfect for enjoying single-player games like AC Valhalla, COD Vanguard, and Forza 5. The Predator game-view technology allows you to separately control the dark and bright portions of the image. So, you can adjust the background, character, and environment color saturation according to your requirements.

      - pro: Predator game-view technology
      - pro: Built-in speakers

          Asus is among the top-rated brands for gaming appliances and
          accessories. The Republic of Gamers is the best place to find the
          highest quality products with innovative features and a reasonable
          price tag. Some users complain about the smaller screen size, but I
          assure you that the screen is more than enough to enjoy AAA game
          titles. Moreover, the smaller screen size helps enhance graphics,
          pixel density, and textures in all games.


          The Extreme Low Motion Blur or ELMB technology ensures smooth gameplay even with a budget gaming build. Similarly, some users complain that they can’t hit enemies even when they shoot on time. The real reason is that your monitor suffers from a slight delay of just a few micro-seconds. As a result, you don’t see the reallocation of your enemy; instead, you get to see his delayed position. 


          In this regard, the Fast IPS technology can help you improve your game experience. Similarly, the 1ms fast response time ensures that the rendered image is displayed correctly without any delay. This is also the reason why most professional gamers use a 240 or 360 Hz gaming monitor when playing competitive matches.


          However, the only issue you might face with this monitor is that the brightness slightly decreases when you turn on the ELMB feature. However, the lower brightness enhances the response time and the contrast ratio for every game. As a result, you can easily differentiate between the in-game environment and the enemies.
    pros:
      - pro: ELMB technology
      - pro: Fast IPS display
      - pro: High-resolution
      - pro: Aura Sync
      - pro: Suitable for Dual-GPUs
      - pro: Adaptive sync

          HP is the ultimate champion of workstations, laptops, and home
          machines. However, it recently shocked the gaming world with its Omen
          products. HP Omen products are widely accepted as the fastest-growing
          community in the world. All this fame comes for a reason, good quality
          and reliable performance. In this regard, if you are looking for a
          straightforward gaming display, I suggest that you buy the HP Omen.


          Every aspect of Omen X is worth praising for several paragraphs. For instance, it offers high brightness, even higher than some Asus ROG monitors. Similarly, the brightness isn’t just uncontrolled luminous; it even offers a contrast ratio of 1000:1. As a result, you will experience the highest picture quality when gaming or enjoying a movie.


          Similarly, HP Omen X enhances the AMD FreeSync technology with its innovative features. Firstly, it smoothens the gaming experience with crisp pixel quality and wide adaptive refresh rate ranges. Similarly, Omen is the first monitor to utilize the FreeSync 2 HDR technology. The Quad HD resolution or 1440P ensures that you notice every single detail in the game environment to make full use of tactical shooting.


          Usually, people complain that the monitor consumes extra power even when they are not gaming. It is mainly because the monitor runs at maximum refresh rate whether you need it or not. On the contrary, the HP Omen X offers adjustable frequency so that you can adjust the frame rate according to the FPS to save your electricity bill. In short, Omen X is the perfect user-friendly gaming monitor with an affordable price tag.
    pros:
      - pro: Adaptive FreeSync 2 HDR
      - pro: Adjustable height
      - pro: Adjustable frequency
      - pro: Affordable price
      - pro: Sharper details
      - pro: Multiple input ports

          You have probably heard about Dell Alienware if you are an old-time
          gamer. Dell is one of the first companies to allocate a separate
          department for the gaming community. Most Esports gamers still use
          Alienware products for their reliability, efficiency, and hardcore
          technology. Moreover, their products are more durable than several
          modern gaming gadgets. In this regard, this list would be incomplete
          without an Alienware beast in it.


          The monitor is optimized for professionals who want to remain ahead of their competitors and for wanna-be pros who are just starting their journey. For instance, the monitor offers half the information gap than any 120 Hz gaming monitor. Gamers can now enjoy an unaltered gaming experience with a whopping 4.16ms information gap. As a result, the user’s response time is faster than every competitor in the game.


          Similarly, the Alienware monitor beats Acer’s claim over the LOL game genre with its incredible visual experience. The higher contrast ratio and true color schemes allow you to visualize all possible traps that remain hidden from your enemies. Moreover, the wide-angle viewing range means that you get access to more information to check those corners without peeking.


          It is a convenient monitor that depends on shortcuts to minimize your setting time. For instance, you can easily navigate the settings menu from the joystick on the right-hand side. You can even allocate shortcuts to different settings to always stay ahead of everyone. 


          Another cool feature of the Dell Alienware monitor is that it is compatible with AMD FreeSync technology. It means that now you can enjoy an enhanced gameplay experience without spending anything extra on your gaming system. The technology minimizes graphic distortions and prevents lagging by directly syncing the GPU with your monitor.
    pros:
      - pro: "Fast response time "
      - pro: Vertical and Horizontal adjustments
      - pro: 4x USB ports
      - pro: AlienFX technology
      - pro: Reasonable price
      - pro: Anti-glare display
      - pro: Joystick controls

  - question: How to use OP like a pro in Valorant?
    answer: Valorant is a game of skills, but it also requires suitable hardware.
      For instance, you can snipe like a pro by using a high-DPI mouse, a stable
      surface, and a high-frequency gaming monitor. Moreover, it would be best
      to practice as much as possible to improve your flicks and reaction time.
  - question: Is it possible to get a 240 Hz monitor with 1440P resolution?
    answer: Yes, some brands like Asus and HP Omen offer 1440P and even higher
      resolution with a 240 Hz refresh rate. However, you can only utilize such
      HD graphics with a suitable high-end gaming PC. Moreover, it would help if
      you used the D-port to enjoy the best gaming experience.
  - answer: Both Fortnite and PUBG are slow-paced shooter games. Unlike call of duty
      and Valorant, which require godly response time. Still, you need at least
      a 120 Hz gaming monitor to enjoy a seamless gaming experience. Moreover,
      you can switch to first-person mode to further enhance your efficiency.
    question: How many Hz do I need for Fortnite and PUBG?
