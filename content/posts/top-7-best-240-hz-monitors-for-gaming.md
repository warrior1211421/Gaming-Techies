paragraphs:
  - paragraph: FPS is an important factor for most competitive gamers. Sometimes,
      the refresh rate even matters more than the resolution and picture
      quality. However, most people use a 60 Hz monitor and complain about game
      lags and coarse gameplay. As a result, they spend hundreds of dollars
      upgrading their gaming system specs, but all efforts go in vain. The main
      reason is that your monitor is the bottlenecking factor in this scenario.
  - paragraph: >-
      So, if you are a gaming enthusiast and want to upgrade your system, I
      suggest that you start with your monitor. In this regard, the best 240 Hz
      monitors seem suitable as they offer a higher refresh rate at a reasonable
      price.


      Furthermore, upgrading your monitor will positively impact your overall gaming experience. For instance, if you experience gaming issues like screen tearing, lagging, and blurring, a new monitor, is the only solution to your problem despite having a high-end gaming PC. Otherwise, it is just like watching a 4K resolution movie on a 2K display, i.e., inefficient.

faqs:
  - question: How to use OP like a pro in Valorant?
    answer: Valorant is a game of skills, but it also requires suitable hardware.
      For instance, you can snipe like a pro by using a high-DPI mouse, a stable
      surface, and a high-frequency gaming monitor. Moreover, it would be best
      to practice as much as possible to improve your flicks and reaction time.
  - question: Is it possible to get a 240 Hz monitor with 1440P resolution?
    answer: Yes, some brands like Asus and HP Omen offer 1440P and even higher
      resolution with a 240 Hz refresh rate. However, you can only utilize such
      HD graphics with a suitable high-end gaming PC. Moreover, it would help if
      you used the D-port to enjoy the best gaming experience.
  - answer: Both Fortnite and PUBG are slow-paced shooter games. Unlike call of duty
      and Valorant, which require godly response time. Still, you need at least
      a 120 Hz gaming monitor to enjoy a seamless gaming experience. Moreover,
      you can switch to first-person mode to further enhance your efficiency.
