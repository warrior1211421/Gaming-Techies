  Although we have mentioned almost all of the best gaming mice perfect for
  Valorant, still there are a lot of things that you have to consider while
  buying the perfect gaming mouse that can entertain you during your Valorant
  game round without letting you regret any of the issues.


  Considering this thing important, we are here with a list of things that you especially need to consider while buying the perfect gaming mouse for Valorant. If you keep these things in mind while buying it, we assure you that you will not have to regret your decision and will enjoy your game with it with greater satisfaction.


  ### DPI


  While buying the best gaming mouse for FPS games like Valorant, make sure to buy a mouse that comes with an option of adjustable DPI option. Aiming is crucial in FPS games. There are some games that require a quick turnaround to make a couple of shots very quickly, and there are some which need a steady aim before shooting. For quick aiming and shooting, you will require a high DPI; however, for steady aim and careful shooting, you need a low DPI.


  It is for this reason that you need to consider the adjustable DPI option in the mouse.


  ### Sweat-resistant coating


  Fast-paced games like Valorant require quick movements that may often make your palms sweaty, which can hinder your speed and performance. To avoid this problem, make sure to eye the mouse that has a sweat-resistant coating.


  There are many mice that come with holes in their surface to make sure that your palms don't get sweaty while you are playing high-speed games like Valorant. There are many others that have a high friction coating that does not make your hands sweaty. So make sure to make a choice carefully and wisely.


  ### Balanced Weight


  Weight is another important factor that you should never ignore in a mouse, especially if you are buying it for a high FPS game like Valorant. The choice of the right completely depends on the individual, but as for guidance, we want to give you a tip while choosing the mouse on the basis of weight.


  For Valorant, consider buying a mouse that has the weight towards the back-end instead of the front-end. This will provide you much control over the mouse and ultimately over your performance. You can also consider the mice that come with the removable weight option so that you can customize your mouse according to your own choice.


  ### Wirelessness


  Although there are many professionals who prefer and suggest the wired mouse for playing games of their choice. However, in recent years the wireless mice have gained much attention. They are perfectly easy to handle, and during the high FPS game that requires a lot of speed and focuses, you really don't have time to tackle the wire tangling issues.


  For this reason, wireless mice are always a good option to go for. They can be used for any genre, including the FPS, and their DPI (16K in some cases) capabilities are far beyond measures to provide you with extraordinary results and convenience for your Valorant game.


  ### Acceleration


  It is another most important thing to consider while buying a perfect mouse for games like Valorant. For lower sensitivity games, greater hand motions are required, and hence teaming with acceleration is the most important thing.


  ### Sensitivity


  To gain a slight edge to win the game, you must consider the effectiveness of the sensors that your mouse is having. The great sensitivity level of the mouse is important in making it quite efficient in picking up the signals on whatever surface you are using it. There are mainly two types of sensors that all gaming mice have.


  Laser sensors are usually installed in the cheaper mice that are a more basic and simpler form of a sensor. They have a projected laser that reads out the surface that you are using. However, there may be some readability issues. These are good when you use smooth mousepads.


  Optical sensors are much more efficient than laser sensors and can scan your surface more accurately as compared to them. The accurate tracking gives them a great edge to be considered as the best sensors that should be installed in the best gaming mice for high FPS games, especially for Valorant, which needs much more speed and accuracy than any other game.


  So we suggest you go for the mouse that comes with these optical sensors to make your game more comfortable, enjoyable, and, most importantly, responsive.
