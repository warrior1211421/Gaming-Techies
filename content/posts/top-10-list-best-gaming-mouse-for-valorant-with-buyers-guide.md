      accurate in your gameplay, you need a good FPS gaming mouse.
    question: Why Valorant needs a great quality mouse?
  - question: Which sensitivity level is best in Valorant?
    answer: Sensitivity completely depends upon the personal preference of an
      individual. However, it is recommended to play a game around 400-800,
      which generally falls under the low DPI. This DPI lets you move your hands
      more swiftly and enables you to make the small wrist movements that are
      effective in maintaining the aim during the game.
  - answer: DPI, also known and Dots Per Inch. And is a measure of the sensitivity
      of the mouse. The greater the DPI, the farther the cursor will move on
      your screen with the small movements. But, a mouse with low DPI has to
      show greater movements to move similar distances on the screen. Both are
      good in their own place, but it completely depends upon the type of game
      you are playing. Some prefer higher DPI and some lower.
    question: Which DPI is better, low DPI or high DPI for gaming?
  - answer: While buying the best gaming mouse for Valorant, keep in mind the
      sensitivity, DPI features, mouse coating, weight, wired/wirelessness, and
      acceleration. Keeping these things in mind will help you a lot in choosing
      the best mouse for your favorite Valorant game.
    question: What are the helpful tips in buying the best gaming mouse for Valorant?
  - answer: Both of the mice are perfectly great in their own place when it comes to
      their performance for a shooting game. However, considering the reviews of
      all the buyers and the professional gamers, we have found out that the
      wired gaming mice perform much better than the wireless, but this doesn't

      also come with some great features that totally meet the standards of
      Valorant, especially their wirelessness, which lets you make some quick
      moves that are direly needed for it.
