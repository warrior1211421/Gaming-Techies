When you want an Ethernet cable for gaming purposes, then we would recommend you to go for Cat-5e and Cat 6, whichever is more convenient buying for you. But if you already have a very high-speed internet connection at your home, then, to support it, you can go for buying Cat-7 and Cat-8, which are much better in their performance and manufacturing than other cables.

So we prefer you not to avoid looking for the material of which the cable is made because there are some materials which can make your buying experience worse by irritating you with their unsatisfactory performance.


  To avoid such problems, what you can do is figure out the type of installation you want of the cable. If you want to install it outdoors, then it must have the materials that could bear out the changing weather and if you would be installing the cable indoors, then choose the Ethernet cable that will provide you maximum protection against the electricity.
