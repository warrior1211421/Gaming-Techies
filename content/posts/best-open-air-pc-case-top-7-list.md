  - paragraph: A PC case is just like the toppings of the cake. No matter how tasty
      the cake is, it isn’t considered good if the toppings aren’t decent. PC
      case provides aesthetics to your machine, whether it is gaming or a
      workstation. It also greatly improves the cooling level of the system due
      to proper air-flow. This helps in keeping the system efficient in terms of
      performance and temperature management.

  There is no standard to compare a PC case. Every case is perfect and unique in
  its own way. It all depends on your taste and requirements. All these
  open-frame pc case have their own set of pros and cons. You won’t be
  disappointed if you choose any of them.


  ## My Recommendation


  I own a **Cougar Conquer ATX** case myself. I have been using it for almost half a year now. Honestly, I am in love with this case. It has the best air-flow system and the most attractive looks. The exterior is made completely out of aluminum and has room for two extra cooling fans. It also has an in-built cable management system.


  The only drawback that I found in it is that it doesn’t have housing for a USB-C port. Luckily, I don’t own a device that uses USB-C, but for those of you who do, you should consider this flaw before purchasing this case.


  ### Did you Know?


  The world’s first non-standard, or should I say innovative, PC case was built in 2006. It was made of an aluminum chassis and designed to allow for hardware extensions. The color of that PC case was inspired by a race-car.


  ## Importance of a Good PC Case


  If you have been saving up to build your dream PC, then your top preference should be a unique PC case. Trust me when I tell you, people will always judge your system by the looks of it. Even if you own a 2080Ti and a Core i9, a poor PC case will always make it judgmental.


   On the other hand, a good looking case shouts out loud that it houses a beast inside it. You don’t have to explain your PC’s hardware to everyone individually in order to impress them. The case does all the talking for you.


  The code of conduct while building a PC is always to make a budget first. After that:


  * Make a list of your hardware requirements.

  * Buy hardware such as processor, ram, SSD, GPU, etc.

  * Buy motherboard according to hardware.

  * Lastly, buy a PC case according to the hardware and motherboard.

  * You can add accessories like RGBs, water cooling, fans later on.

  The PC case is a one-time purchase most of the time. You can upgrade the
  hardware later, but you will scarcely consider upgrading the case. Because the
  fact is, upgrading the PC case is like building the PC all over again.
  Therefore, you should be thoughtful before purchasing your PC case. There are
  some factors that you need to consider before making your choice:


  * Space requirements

  * Looks

  * Price

  * Air-flow

  * Housing compatibilities.

  * Future upgradation

  * Weight and size


  All these factors determine whether you chose perfectly or now. Now I will briefly describe all these factors


  ### Space Requirements


  The PC case is just like a house, and your hardware the residents of that building. You need to consider the space requirements for each component individually before making your choice.


  First of all, the motherboard size and type need to be taken into consideration. The motherboards are available in four main sizes:


  * Mini ITX

  * Micro ATX

  * Extended ATX

  * Standard ATX


  You need to know the size and dimensions of your motherboard and then check the case’s compatibility with that size. Similarly,  components such as GPUs and PSUs require separate space to work properly. If the case is not spacious enough for these components, they may not fit properly to the motherboard. You will then be required to make alterations to the PC case. 70% of the time, alterations result in ruining the looks of the case.


  ### Looks


  Looks matter the most when it comes to the PC case. An original PC enthusiast would always prefer the looks of his PC to his own. You need to have the perfect design and color to go with your hardware. In modern PCs, color combinations are selected on the basis of hardware and lighting color. Many gaming rigs are designed according to a theme to make them look unique.


  ### Price


  When buying a PC case, obviously, you need to consider whether it can fit in your wallet or not. You don’t want to spend too much on the case that you don’t have money for other accessories. You should always choose your personal requirements over features and luxury. It is a PC case, not a limo.


  ### Air-Flow


  The main purpose served by a perfect case is that it keeps the interior well ventilated. A proper airflow increases your hardware performance by a factor of two. It even saves your electricity because the fans have to do less work to keep the system cool.


  Cooling fans also play an important role in maintaining a proper airflow inside the computer. Much Open-air case comes with the option to install two or more external fans to push the air inside. These fans are known as exhaust fans because they provide air to internal fans for PC-wide circulation. A properly ventilated system can increase your gaming FPS (frames per second) by at least 10 to 20 points. Being a gamer myself, I know that such numbers prove themselves to be a real game-changer.


  ### Housing


  This factor is almost the same as space requirements. But it deals with much smaller components such as USB ports, magnetic dust collectors, liquid cooling systems, etc. You need to determine your hardware accessories requirements before choosing a PC case.


  For example, I knew that I am not going to have any need for a USB-C port. Therefore, I find my case to be the most suitable for me. You need to consider these requirements before making the purchase because alterations can really give you a serious headache.


  ### Upgradation


  You need to consider whether there will be any hardware upgrades in the near future or not. This is because some hardware is bigger than their previous models because they pack even more power inside them. Suppose you are one of those lads who upgrade their graphics card every year to the newest model. In that case, you need to buy a PC case slightly bigger than your requirements so that it can house any bigger and better components that you put in it.


  The same consideration should be provided for liquid cooling. If you are not installing it now, but you see yourself upgrading the cooling system of the gaming rig. Then you should buy a PC case that can house liquid coolers and radiators.
