          ASRock is an emerging brand in the motherboard universe. They have
          proved to be a great upset for all major brands in the motherboard
          industry. All ASRock motherboards are highly durable due to the
          stainless-steel mainboard along with the reinforced driver guards with
          built-in heatsinks. So, if you plan to build a small yet powerful
          gaming PC on a limited budget, I highly recommend the ASRock AB350M
          for you.


          ASRock has proved that high performance with durability and a smaller form factor doesn’t necessarily mean an expensive build. For instance, ASRock has accomplished all these milestones while keeping your budget in check. The whole motherboard is designed to provide exceptional durability for all PC enthusiasts. Moreover, the smaller form factor ensures that your motherboard perfectly fits every CPU casing in the world. Similarly, another benefit of the smaller form factor in a large case is greater ventilation and plenty of room for the airflow in the system.


          However, you don’t have to worry about the short circuits due to the use of stainless steel rather than a semi-conductor. The insulation is achieved by coating the steel material with a special semi-conductor material. Moreover, this material is thermally stable and conducts a maximum amount of heat to the heatsinks. Secondly, the improved slot selection ensures that you don’t overpopulation your system even after installing all the important system components.


          You get plenty of useful input slots in the ASRock motherboards. For instance, you can install two M2 chips, six SATA drives, two GPUs, connection chips, and four Ram modules and still have plenty of room for other components like an AIO water cooling system. The only drawback is that the BIOS is not as user-friendly, and you can only use AMD Crossfire cards for multi-GPU support.

          AMD Ryzen 5 2600x is no doubt pre-unlocked for overclocking. However,
          you still need a suitable motherboard to sustain the immense power
          potential of this processor. Overclocking means that you will unleash
          the true performance of the processor, which is something extra. So,
          you must be ready to pay the excessive price that comes with it. The
          ROG Crosshair VI Extreme motherboard is a bit expensive even than the
          Asus Strix motherboards, but the price is well-justified by the
          advanced features that you get. So, if you are an overclocking
          enthusiast, I highly recommend that you should never settle for
          anything less than the best.


          The list of advanced features that you get with any Crosshair Extreme motherboard can go on for several paragraphs. It seems as if Asus took only the best features from all their sub-brands and included them in the Crosshair platform. For instance, the Strix motherboards are notorious for their AI-powered features. So, the Crosshair VI motherboard provides automatic optimization where it is needed. The cooling system is well suitable for your overclocking needs. So, the system will never overheat even when the various components draw more than normal power from the system. Similarly, the 8+2 VRM power stages ensure that there is plenty of juice available whenever you want to squeeze every bit of performance from your system.


          As a matter of fact, Crosshair is one of the first AMD motherboards ever since the first AM2 sockets. So, it won’t be wrong to expect a great deal of innovation and optimization in this motherboard. The 5-way optimization keeps your system alive by allowing the various hardware components to communicate with each other actively. Moreover, you won’t see any shiny metal components on the motherboard.
