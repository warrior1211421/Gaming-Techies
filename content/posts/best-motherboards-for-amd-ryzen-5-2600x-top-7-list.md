  - paragraph: The demand for Ryzen gaming setups is constantly increasing by
      professional computer users. However, the processor world is less likely
      to experience major technological upgrades for the next 4-5 years.
      Nevertheless, we’ll never leave you alone in your search for the **best
      motherboard for Ryzen 5 2600x.**

  Believe it or not, it’s all a game of who provides a greater number of threads
  and cores at lower prices. Currently, the processor market is owned by two
  competitors: Intel and AMD, and AMD seems to rule the market these days. They
  introduce a new, powerful and affordable line of AMD processors that Intel
  can’t accomplish any time soon.


  ## Ryzen 5 2600x vs. Intel Core i7 8700k


  For instance, the **[AMD Ryzen 5 2600x](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-Processor-Wraith-Cooler/dp/B07B428V2L?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=22a0e2cf15a80f2e31a59a541bc1e9ab&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is AMD’s response to** [Intel Core i7 8700K](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-8700K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B07598VZR8?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=c6ae6e77dbe22abde6c4d923522f5f9e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)**. However, the former is more versatile, highly optimized for gaming, and sells at least $60 cheaper than the i7. Ryzen 5 2600x is the fastest high-end gaming processor that you can get in this price range. Intel It comes with six cores and 12 threads in total. Such specs are nowhere to be found in any 8th or even the 9th gen Intel processors.


  Moreover, it provides a 16MB L3 cache, while the i7 8700k only offers 12MB L3. Similarly, the Ryzen 5 2600x is unlocked for overclocking right out of the box, whereas Intel requires special system tweaking for a particular clock speed.


  Finally, all Ryzen processors come with a cooler, while you need to buy it separately in case of an Intel processor. So, you save money on both processor and the cooler when you buy a Ryzen 5 2600x for the processor.

          A common myth among the folks is that you need to be a tech specialist
          in order to build and use a gaming PC. However, it is only partially
          true to some extent. You need to be an expert in technology only if
          you are into PC mods and system tweaking. Other than that, you only
          need a significant budget to afford various powerful gaming hardware
          and the Gigabyte Aorus motherboards.


          Gigabyte is known to produce user-friendly best motherboards for beginners and inexperienced gamers. All the core features of their motherboards lead to the best performance experience with minimum customization compared to all the other boards. Unlike Asus Strix boards that require quite a bit of technology experience to build your PC at home.


          Especially, this aorus ultra gaming for USB Type C port, PCIe slots/memory slots, and gigabyte **[ethernet](https://gamingtechies.com/best-ethernet-cable/)** (Gaming Cables) is one of the best motherboards of its type.


          For instance, the **[B450](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FW85VFT?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=7cf8e63de6b003317c4ded4466c0012a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** motherboard comes with an easy-to-use BIOS that provides all the important information with little room for system tweaking. However, you can still access the more advanced features by unlocking the BIOS from the settings.


          This motherboard is probably the best thing that can ever happen to your gaming system. For instance, all the drive guards and the I/O ports are colored with the signature orange-black contrast. Gigabyte also provides both RGB lighting and an improved aesthetic experience. You can set the color scheme for your system by using the RGB Fusion 2.0 support software.


          Similarly, this aorus ultra gaming motherboard provides just enough cooling system to ensure optimum temperature all the time. The 12+1 power stages efficiently distribute the power generated from the PSU throughout the motherboard while keeping some power in reserve for overclocking.


          Gigabyte aorus ultra gaming has all the important system ports for your various hardware. For example, you can install two M2 SSD cards in the motherboard along with six SATA ports. All these drives are protected with a dedicated heatsink thermal guard to protect your system from overheating. You can also set up a dual-GPU system to double the fun. However, it only supports **[AMD Crossfire](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/crossfire)** (Check what is Crossfire Technology) for multiple graphics cards.

          both **[X](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-X-mean-in-AMD-processors)** and
          B AMD chips in their motherboards. As you know, the B-xxx system
          chipsets are more powerful than the X series due to several reasons.
          For instance, the B450 chip provides more room for overclocking,
          hardcore gaming, and system tweaking than the x370 chipset. **[MSI
          B450](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FP11742?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=e4fa5a417bcdd4fef33de744f0c1d8ab&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** Gaming
          Pro Carbon is very similar to the c370 version as it comes with very
          similar features, but the advanced chipset justifies the higher price
          tag.


          The motherboard is very stable in terms of thermal and power efficiency. For instance, it covers all the vital components of a desktop computer like the dual M2 slots, the SATA slots/ports, USB ports, and the processor slot with an improved thermal guard. This guard monitors the system temperatures in real-time and gradually optimizes the fan speed accordingly.


          Similarly, the power stages are further improved to provide more room for overclocking. The system ensures that an optimum power supply is provided to the processor and the graphics card as it draws more power from the system.


          **[MSI B450](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FP11742?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=e4fa5a417bcdd4fef33de744f0c1d8ab&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** is a reliable motherboard that provides just the right amount of ventilation throughout the motherboard. For instance, the heatsinks cover the VRM and PCIe slots as well. This prevents the system from choking even during hot climate conditions.


          However, keeping your gaming rig in a well-ventilated area is recommended to prevent the case fans from choking. Your [BIOS](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/) (Best Bios Settings for Gaming) further optimizes the system transfer rate that you can customize according to your preferences. You also get the signature Carbon look and dual graphics card support for both **[SLI and Crossfire](https://techguided.com/sli-vs-crossfire-is-it-worth-it/#:~:text=Both%20SLI%20and%20CrossFire%20accomplish,data%20between%20multiple%20graphics%20cards.&text=First%2C%20SLI%20is%20NVIDIA's%20multi,is%20AMD's%20multi%2DGPU%20solution.)** (Difference between them)architectures.


          In addition, the 16.8 million/17 effects RGB headers provide one of the best choices for customization. You can change and keep your choice's colors to make it look extraordinary in your gaming community.


          All these features combine to make this one of the best motherboards for the Ryzen 5 2600x that you can buy to enjoy all your high-end games.

          **[ASRock](https://www.asrock.com/)** is most probably the best micro
          atx motherboard and is an emerging brand in the motherboard universe.
          They have proved to be a great upset for all major brands in the
          motherboard industry. All ASRock motherboards are highly durable due
          to the stainless-steel mainboards nowadays, along with the reinforced
          driver guards with built-in heatsinks.


          So, if you plan to build a small yet powerful gaming PC on a limited budget, I highly recommend the **[ASRock AB350M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X9LN3QK?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=fcf8dc45656f9b780ec6da881613a27b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** for you.


          The main reason I recommend this motherboard brand is that it provides advanced features like the Asus ROG and MSI boards, with enhanced durability and a budget-friendly price. However, if you are after a board that provides room for overclocking, it would be best to buy Asus Strix.


          ASRock has proved that durability and a smaller form factor don’t necessarily mean an expensive build. For instance, ASRock has accomplished all these milestones at low prices and in your preset tight budget.


          The whole motherboard works to provide exceptional durability for all PC enthusiasts. The smaller form factor ensures that your gaming motherboard perfectly fits every CPU casing in the world. Similarly, another benefit of the smaller form factor in a large case is greater ventilation and plenty of room for the airflow in the system.


          However, you don’t have to worry about the short circuits due to the use of stainless steel rather than a semi-conductor. Besides, this cheap motherboard also comes with both USB Type-A ports and USB Type C ports and a quality CPU socket.


          The insulation is achieved by coating the steel material with a special semi-conductor material. Moreover, this material is thermally stable and conducts a maximum amount of heat to the heatsinks. Secondly, the improved slot selection ensures that you don’t overpopulate your personal computer even after installing all the important system components.


          You get plenty of useful input slots in the **[ASRock motherboards.](https://www.asrock.com/mb/)** For instance, you can install two M2 chips, six SATA drives, two GPUs, connection chips, and four RAM/slots and still have plenty of room for other components like an AIO water cooling system. The only drawback is that the BIOS is not as user-friendly, and you can only use AMD Crossfire cards for multi-GPU support.


          Getting the best motherboard for ryzen 5 2600x at this price is like a dream come true. These key features make it stand prominent premium motherboards and a perfect choice for you to complete a high-quality mid-end gaming build.

          AMD Ryzen 5 2600x is no doubt pre-unlocked for overclocking. However,
          you still need a suitable motherboard to sustain the immense power
          potential of this processor. Overclocking means that you will unleash
          the true performance of the high-end processors, which is something
          extra. So, you must be ready to pay the excessive price that comes
          with it.


          The ROG Crosshair VI Extreme motherboard is a bit expensive even than the Asus Strix motherboards, but the price is well-justified by the advanced key features that you get. So, if you are an overclocking enthusiast, I highly recommend that you should never settle for anything less than the best.


          The list of advanced features that you get with any **[Crosshair Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748HV4B4?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=33dd176662e6a7f2e9a64486021d5ae8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** motherboard can go on for several paragraphs. It seems as if Asus took only the best features from all their sub-brands and included them in the Crosshair platform.


          For instance, the Strix motherboards are notorious for their AI-powered features. So, the Crosshair VI motherboard provides automatic optimization where it is needed. The cooling system is well suitable for your overclocking needs.


          So, the system will never overheat even when the various components draw more than normal power from the system. Similarly, the 8+2 VRM power stages ensure that there is plenty of juice available whenever you want to squeeze every bit of performance from your system.


          As a matter of fact, Crosshair is one of the first motherboards for AMD Ryzen series processors ever since the first **[AM2 sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM2).** So, it won’t be wrong to expect a great deal of innovation and optimization in this motherboard. The **[5-way optimization keeps your system alive](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-keep-gpu-cool/)** (How to keep your GPU cool) by allowing the various hardware components to communicate with each other actively.


          Moreover, you won’t see any shiny metal components on the motherboard. It is because all the vital components are protected by the advanced Asus thermal guards that ensure optimum system temperatures all the time. This powerful motherboard is supported by an overclocking-friendly system [BIOS](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/), so there is plenty of room for customization as well.

      - paragraph: >-
          **Asus Strix** motherboards are known as the best mid-range products
          with great potential in terms of features and compatibility. Asus
          Strix is the first brand to introduce artificial intelligence in its
          motherboards. So, there is great potential if you want to build a
          system in the long run.


          For instance, the motherboard supports several generations of Ryzen processors. So, even if you start with a smaller processor, there is plenty of room for future upgrades. In this regard,** [Asus Strix B359](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071SGQP1Q?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=6f2cee834a0eaddcfc275c5c9e0e1617&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) i**s the best budget motherboard for every AMD enthusiast out there.


          If you are not short on budget, you won't find a better motherboard than Asus Strix. It provides such advanced features that almost double the performance of the Ryzen 5. Moreover, the transition from MSI or Gigabyte to the Strix mobo is very smooth. You won't even feel a single problem, and instantly fall in love with the capabilities of this motherboard.


          Asus Strix has a great quality of consistency in all their product ranges. For instance, you get the same features as the Intel model in the AM4 models as well. The best of these features is the AI-powered system that no other competitor has managed to recreate in their products.


          This AI system enhances your gaming experience by performance and power optimization on its own. For example, the 6+2 power stages ensure that you have plenty of juice at hand for overclocking and hardcore gaming.


          However, I won’t recommend this motherboard if you want to squeeze every drop of performance juice from your system. Other than that, this product is more than capable of all your gaming requirements. Similarly, the AI-powered overclocking chip protects your hardware from burning. The system stops overclocking as soon as you reach the safe limits as described by the manufacturer.


          Moreover, it comes with a powerful Asus ram memory technology and is one of the few motherboards to offer Ram overclocking directly from the BIOS setup. Similarly, this board also provides just enough ventilation through the air- and water-cooling systems combined with the smart temperature sensors in the VRM and M2 ports.


          This motherboard provides plenty of input ports for your various hardware and accessories. It supports USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.2 Type A and Type C reversible connectors. Along with dual-GPU slots with SLI and Crossfire support. So, you can install both ATI and** [Nvidia graphic cards](https://store.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/store/)** in your setup to enhance the performance even more.
    pros:
      - pro: "Asus aura sync RGBs "
      - pro: "Advanced cooling system "
      - pro: It supports multiple ryzen generations
      - pro: "Suitable for heavy gaming sessions "
      - pro: "AI-powered features "
      - pro: "E-Sports quality performance "
