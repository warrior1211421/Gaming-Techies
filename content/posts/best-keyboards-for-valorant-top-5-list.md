  Some people consider the keyboard as an afterthought component of their gaming
  setup. In reality, 20% of your gaming experience depends on the mouse and
  keyboard of your rig. Using an outdated keyboard with even the latest gaming
  system may get in the way of your gaming experience. It is because the best
  gaming keyboards have soft keys that further increase your reaction time.


  When it comes to playing Valorant, fast reaction time is the key to success. It is because you greatly rely on your abilities to outsmart your enemy or set the traps. For instance, you constantly have to use the special abilities of Reyna to avoid getting surrounded by enemies. Similarly, you get less than 10 seconds to set traps before the match starts with Killjoy. This is especially vital when you are on the defending side. In short, Valorant is the name of a fast-paced shooter combined with special abilities to outrun and outsmart the enemy quickly.


  The market is full of good-looking gaming keyboards that brag about precision and ease of use. However, the real test starts only after you purchase and test one for yourself. Most of the time, the aesthetically beautiful keyboards don’t perform as well due to delayed input times or hard keys. Therefore, it is best to choose a branded keyboard so that you can enjoy your gaming to the fullest.

  Choosing a simple gadget like a keyboard can be very confusing, especially if
  you are not a tech-geek. Manufacturers boast all kinds of features in their
  products that are often irrelevant to your requirements. However, there are
  some factors that you should consider making the full out of your hard-earned
  money. Some of these features are:


  ### Media Controls


  Media control keys have been around for over a decade now. Even now, some brands don’t consider the importance of these keys and ignore them in the design. The media controls are very useful, especially when you enjoy listening to music while gaming or working. The media keys allow you to play/pause the song or even adjust the volume without switching the program.


  ### Mechanical Keys


  Mechanical keys are the biggest reason why people prefer gaming keyboards over others. It increases the durability of the keyboard, suppresses the noise, and provides a satisfying click sound whenever you press a button. The mechanism behind a mechanical key is known as a switch. This switch is responsible for decreasing the response time and silencing the key noise. Moreover, you don’t have to press a mechanical key is hard as other keyboards to get the job done.


  ### Spill Resistance


  Everyone enjoys eating or drinking during work and gaming sessions. However, there is a great chance that your hand slips and you spill some on the keyboard. 70% of the time, the fluid penetrates the keyboard structure and causes short circuits. Therefore, you need a spill-resistant keyboard to protect your gadgets from water and dust damage. The spill-resistant technology prevents any water leakage into the keyboard, and the dust resistance keeps your keyboard neat all the time.


  ### Programmable Keys


  Macro are programmable keys usually present in all mechanical keyboards. The main function of these special buttons is that they have no function. In other words, you can assign complex key combinations to a single macro key. It places all the buttons within your reach whether you are playing Valorant or working. Different brands use different names and technologies for the programmable keys. For example, HyperX provides programmable capabilities for the whole keyboard.

          Razer has earned its share of the gaming market through high-quality
          accessories. Even if you are just getting started in the gaming world,
          you will find yourself longing for one of Razer’s gaming products in
          your setup. Razer BlackWidow TE Chroma v2 is the perfect keyboard for
          all gaming formats. However, it is not preferably the best keyboard
          for work/game sessions. Still, several streamers have been spotted
          using this product for its convenient design and affordable price.


          The V1 of the keyboard was criticized as the best keyboard without ten-key and dedicated macro keys. However, Razer improvised with their second version of the product. This keyboard includes both the lacking features along with several other improvements. For instance, it is a linear and silent keyboard that doesn’t disturb others when you are gaming during the night. So, you won’t be getting any complaints from the neighbors to keep it down.


          The dedicated macro keys are programmable. It means that you can assign a single key or a key combination to perform complex tasks. For instance, when playing on Jett, the smoke and hyperjump is the most dangerous tactic in the whole game. However, it requires you to press two keys that may take some time. Fortunately, you can assign a single macro key to get the job done with a single keypress.


          The only problem that I find with this keyboard is the placement of the RGBs. The key symbols are painted green rather than the whole button. So, I faced some difficulties finding the right key when playing in a dark room. However, the situation improved as I got to the key placement over time. Other than that, the 16.8 million backlight options make this one of the most elegant keyboards that I have ever had.

          Corsair has been in the competition for several years. Initially, they
          only focused on gaming hardware like Rams, but they improvised by
          setting foot in the accessories market as well. It is a well-known
          fact that no one can beat the innovations of Corsair, especially in
          their premium products. The only problem is that Corsair accessories
          cost a few more bucks as compared to other brands, but the innovative
          features make it worth every penny. Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 is the latest
          product that won’t be a hurdle in your perfect gaming experience.


          It is not every day that you buy a new keyboard for the system, i.e., keyboards are supposed to be permanent equipment that you can use with several gaming stations. However, the low-quality materials of other keyboards make it seem like a disposable piece of equipment. Fortunately, the Corsair K70 isn’t one of those products. The aluminum build makes it one of the most durable keyboards in the market.


          Secondly, size matters when you plan to spend hours over the keyboard. The bigger the keyboard, the less likely it is for you to press the wrong key even without looking. So, the Corsair K70 is a full-sized keyboard with optimum key placement to ensure that you press the right button every time.


          Furthermore, the Cherry MX switches provide the same feature as the programmable macro keys of Razer. You can assign your desired key combination to a single key to enhance your gameplay.


          Moreover, the grey-colored MX switches are like a blank slate. So, you don’t have to remember every key as you can mark it with a permanent marker.
    cons:
      - con: Relatively Expensive than Other Products

          HyperX is the second name of unmatched performance at an affordable
          price. So, when you can’t find the right word, just say HyperX, and
          the others will get what you mean. HyperX Alloy FPS Pro is one of the
          few recommended keyboards for work + gaming experience. The elegant
          design and the satisfying mechanical keypress make you keep wanting to
          press more keys all the time. So, if you spend several hours on the
          keyboard, I highly recommend that you check out this keyboard.


          I have a bad news and a good news, just like the Irish joke. The bad news is that you don’t get separate programmable macro keys with this keyboard. The good news is that all the keys are programmable from the HyperX keyboard assistant. So, you don’t have to drag your hand across the keyboard just to press the enter key. My suggestion is that you reassign the “~” to function as the Enter button for your convenience; you don’t use it anyways.


          Secondly, the compact form factor places every key within your reach. Sometimes, you don’t even have to pick your hand just to press a button on the other end of the board. Similarly, the sturdy build quality makes this keyboard suitable for several years of functionality. The gaming PCs may come and go, but your HyperX keyboard is permanent and the companion for every system.


          Lastly, you get two USB ports with this keyboard. One input port is to attach the connection USB cable for the keyboard. This ensures that you don’t need to replace the keyboard in case the USB cable is damaged. So, it further increases the lifespan of the HyperX keyboard. Moreover, the second USB port is for charging output. You can charge other devices at 2A-5V while you conquer all the maps of Valorant.
    pros:
      - pro: "Ten-Keyless Design for Gaming "
      - pro: RGB Backlit
      - pro: "Affordable Price "
      - pro: "Programmable Keyboard "
      - pro: "Silver Speed Switches "
      - pro: "USB Passthrough Output Port "
    cons:

          According to research, the keyboard is the sole victim of gaming
          frustrations. So, you need a durable keyboard to withstand all your
          anger and frustration after losing one round. ROCCAT Vulcan 100 is one
          such gaming keyboard for the job. Its versatile steel framework makes
          it highly durable and resistant to impact damage at an affordable
          price. So, if you are looking for a durable gaming keyboard at an
          affordable price, I suggest you check this one out.


          Honestly, I think that ROCCAT Vulcan 100 has the most satisfying keypress feel in all the products. The switch bounce technology brings back the button within a fraction of a second, ready to be pressed again. Moreover, the low tactility value ensures that you don’t have to bang hard on the keys for proper functionality. However, it doesn’t take away the satisfaction of a mechanical keyboard. So, you can jump on the Enter button after every line without any problems.


          The mesh design of the keyboard is yet another innovative feature. It prevents moisture from being trapped inside the keyboard. Similarly, the spill-proof technology prevents moisture from penetrating into the keyboard structure. In short, the Vulcan 100 is an all-in waterproof keyboard so spill as much as you like.


          The AIMO technology RGBs are more accurate and sharper than any other in the world. It is because the high-quality waterproof LEDs make it a glow-in-the-dark keyboard. Moreover, you can choose from 16.8 million colors to choose the best color scheme for your setup
    pros:
      - pro: Dust and Waterproof
      - pro: Titan Switches
      - pro: "Impact-resistant "
      - pro: "AIMO Backlit "
      - pro: "Silent Keypress "
      - pro: "Switch Bounce Technology "
    cons:
      - con: It Doesn’t Come with a Detachable Palm Rest

          Logitech is all about speed and accuracy in its products. For
          instance, Logitech mice have the highest Dpi, Logitech headsets
          provide real-time surround accuracy, and the Logitech keyboards have
          the fastest response time in the world. Similarly, the Logitech G213
          keyboard provides up to 10ms faster response time than any other
          product on the list. So, if you are a fast-paced Valorant gamer, I
          suggest that you get one of these bad boys for your system.


          The main problem with full-sized keyboards is that you don’t have direct access to all the keys. For example, if you are playing a game that involves Enter button, you have to remove your hand to press it. However, the G213 is different from other keyboards in the market. With this keyboard, you get the accessibility of compact keyboards during the space of the large keyboard in one product. The extended design provides more room for palm rest so that your wrists don’t get fatigued after long gaming sessions.


          Secondly, the Romer-G mechanical switches make key pressing a whole new adventure. The feel is so satisfactory that you always want to press more and more. Similarly, the mechanical keys are silent yet responsive. So, the product is suitable for both work and gaming at the same time. The faster response time ensures that you are the first to react in any situation, and believe me, Valorant requires such response time all the time.


          The keyboard is highly durable as the framework is reinforced with steel, and the keys are protected with design improvements. So, you can take out your frustration on the keys after any failure, and the keyboard won’t mind. Furthermore, the active LightSync RGB system can be customized from the Logitech support software. So, you can change the color to create a whole new vibe for the system.

      - pro: Detachable USB Cable
      - pro: "Fast Response Time "
    cons:
      - con: The Keyboard is Slightly on the Compact Form Factor Side
conclusion:
  - paragraph: The keyboard plays a crucial role in all multiplayer shooters,
      especially Valorant. You have to timely press the button to activate a
      special ability in time. Therefore, having a suitable keyboard for gaming
      is a must-have for everyone. In this article, I have provided the top 5
      **best keyboards for Valorant.**
faqs:
  - answer: The mechanism behind mechanical keyboards is known as the switch.
      Basically, the switch is responsible for durability, response time, noise
      suppression, and the satisfying keyboard click sound.
    question: What is the Switch in Gaming Keyboards?
  - question: What is the Best Keyboard for Valorant?
    answer: I am a Valorant player myself; I use Razer BlackWidow TE Chroma v2 for
      my gaming sessions. It comes with a palm rest, programmable macro keys,
      and super soft key presses. Moreover, it is available at an affordable
      price as compared to other products in the market.
  - question: Are all Gaming Keyboards Waterproof?
    answer: No, not all keyboards have spill resistance technology. The spill
      resistance technology prevents any fluid from penetrating the keyboard,
      and the absorbed moisture gets dried quickly, so if you like to eat snacks
      while gaming, I suggest that you get a keyboard with spill resistance.
