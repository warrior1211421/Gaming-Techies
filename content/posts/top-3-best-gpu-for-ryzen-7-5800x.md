  Buying the best graphics card for your gaming system is not an easy task: you
  have to consider a lot of features and factors to never fall for the wrong
  one. 


  Why you ever need to consider them? These factors are recommended considering mainly because they differentiate the quality graphics cards from the ordinary ones. These factors help you choose the **best GPUs for your gaming system** so that you can get the most amazing and memorable gaming experience any time you want. 


  What are the factors that you need to consider? Well! We have compiled a list of 6 factors that you must not ignore looking for in your GPU if you really want to rise up as a good decision-maker. 


  Here are those factors that we want you to consider: 


  ### Clock Speed


  Clock speed refers to the speed of a processor that it shows up in completing a processing cycle. It is the most important aspect of a processor to consider, especially if you are to use it for gaming purposes. It is generally provided to it by the GPU that you install in it. It is, therefore, an important thing to consider when you are looking for one. 


  ***Also, to make your GPU work perfectly for you, you need to consider the maximum temperature to which your GPU can rise: it must be able to handle more heavy gaming operations without ever showing up the signs of over-heating and speed lagging during the time.*** 


  Thus, when you buy a GPU for your gaming set-up, you must need to figure out the clock speed and the highest temperature to which the GPU can go up while performing different operations. 


  ### Number of Cores


  GPU is made such that it contains hundreds of smaller cores that operate together to process the data in the application. This architecture is something that makes it powerful enough to showcase high compute performance. 


  Keeping these things in mind, what you need to look out for in a GPU is how many cores does it contain. We suggest you buy a unit with a greater number of cores. Greater the number better will be the performance, and better you will be able to enjoy all your newest games on your gaming system. 


  ***Since you are looking for a GPU that would go with your AMD process, then considering a GPU with above 1500-2000 cores would help you most in your gaming. Since AMD processor’s compatible processors are manufactured with containing cores between 1,000 and 2,500.*** 


  Keeping your gaming need in mind and the performance you want from your GPU will help you figure out how many cores you want to have in your chosen one so that it could become the best choice for the purpose. 


  ### Memory Size


  The third and the most important thing that you have to look out for in a GPU is its support tendency for maximum memory size. It is important to consider in a GPU since all the high-end open-world games memory size is a vital thing. 


  ***It is thus important to consider a GPU for purchase that comes with greater support for greater memory size. The reason for this is that it will help you load more gaming-world at once, and you will face no issue playing any of them.*** 


  ### Power Consumption 


  Last but not least, you should never ignore the capacity of power consumption of the GPU. This might become a noticeable issue for you, especially if your system is running 24/7. This can lead to paying additional costs in the form of utility bills. 


  ***So, what you should do is, consider buying a GPU that comes with a lower power consumption level: lower the power consumption level, lighter can be your pocket.*** 


  So, buy one with a wiser mind! 


  Concluding the discussion, these were some of the things/ factors that you must need to consider while buying a GPU for your gaming system, especially the **Ryzen 7 5800X.** Considering these things in the GPU will help you get rid of many issues that can irritate you in both the short and long term.
