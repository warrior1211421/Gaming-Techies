          AKG 712 Pro was the ultimate professional audiophile headphone for top
          audio engineers a few decades ago. The device promised several amazing
          features that ensured perfect sound accuracy and noise cancellation
          for the studios. However, those best headphones were very expensive
          and hard to get for ordinary users. Fortunately, Drop collaborated
          with AKG to re-release the iconic headphones as an anniversary
          edition. The new AKG 712 Pro includes several performance upgrades and
          comes with an affordable price tag.


          AKG maintains its top position even after so many years since its first release. It is mainly because AKG is mindful of the competitors' mistakes. For instance, consumers fancy the detachable AUX cord, so they provided this feature in the K712 Pro. Similarly, AKG is one of the few open back headphones whose sound doesn't leak even at maximum volume, a feature that even HiFiman failed to provide.


          This simple-looking headphone packs more power than you have ever experienced, even in premium headphones. For example, the sophisticated open technology provides outstanding sound clarity without compromising even a single nuance. This feature is potentially suitable for FPS games as they need to hear every whisper to determine the opponent’s activities behind blind spots accurately. For instance, you can hear the in game sound if a player is coming from the portal when playing Valorant.


          Similarly, the headphone boasts that you will never want to take them off. Such a level of comfort is achieved with the thick, soft valor earcups and the double layered headband cushion. The ergonomic design of the leather-coated headband ensures a perfect fit even with a single hand. Similarly, you also get a removable audio cable with this headphone to always replace it with new to renew the service life.
    pros:
      - pro: "Sophisticated open technology "
      - pro: 3dB enhanced sound
      - pro: Premium headphones
      - pro: Affordable price
      - pro: Ergonomic design

          Being is gamer doesn’t necessarily mean that your whole world should
          revolve around gaming. Sometimes, even professional gamers need some
          relaxation time for mental relaxation. What other option is better
          than music and movies to clear your mind? Therefore, the Meze 99 Neo
          is the best all-in-one headphone for your gaming setup.


          Some people think that audiophile gamer headset only comes in the open back. Though it is true to some extent, Meze broke the stereotype with their new release.

However, Meze 99 is very different from other gaming headphones in the market. It doesn’t require any additional amplifier to deliver the high fidelity sound that you need. Similarly, the 26Ohm further reduces the power consumption, making it suitable for all entertainment devices.


          However, the power-efficient device doesn’t mean that you will be missing out on the audio performance. The device provides more than enough sound clarity and bass depth to indulge you in a perfect gameplay experience. Furthermore, the ear cups are very easy on the ears and don’t cause unnecessary strain from wearing headphones. The self-adjusting PU ear pads ensure perfect grip on the ears without pushing against your head. You also get a hard-carrying pouch with the headphone to take it wherever you go and use it as an everyday headphone.

          Modern gaming has evolved a lot in the last decade. It isn’t about
          personal enjoyment and relaxation anymore. For some people, gaming is
          a passion and a profession. Such individuals require a headphone that
          delivers something extra other than the conventional high-quality
          sound. For example, you need headphones to monitor all the ups and
          downs in the sound when editing a streaming video to upload.
          Fortunately, Neumann NDH20 is one such audiophile headphone for
          gaming. So, if you are a professional game streamer, what’s keeping

For example, the AKG has low audio, HiFiMan leaks sound, and the Shure headphone doesn't provide optimum sound for music and movies.

So, the headphone can withstand impact damage and will last for at least 5-years if you use them with proper care. Moreover, you can place it in the hard case when traveling to increase the lifespan further. However, it is recommended to use a pre-amp or amplifier with the headphone for critical listening.
