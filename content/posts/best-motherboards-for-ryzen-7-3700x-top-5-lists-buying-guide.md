  Considering the chipset type is one of the most important things. All these chipsets are known for providing the best performance; however, still, X570 chipsets are known to be the best among all. It will provide you with better performance and overclocking than other mentioned chipsets.


  ### Form Factor 


  The next thing that you have to look for in a motherboard is the form factor: **[micro ATX, ATX, or Mini ITX.](https://gamingtechies.com/micro-atx-vs-mini-atx-vs-atx/)** The reason it is important to consider in a motherboard is that it helps you ensure that the size of your motherboard and the cabinet are compatible with each other. If the sizes are compatible, the motherboard will easily fit into the cabinet; otherwise, It would be highly impossible for you to do that.  


  Among the previously mentioned form factors, ATX is designed to provide you highly compatibility and increase connectivity options. While on the other hand, Mini ITX is designed for compact builds.

  Most of the motherboards include four memory slots that are powerful enough to handle a maximum of up to 64 or 128 GB of RAM that is quite high for most users. So, we suggest you buy a motherboard that comes with similar or more memory slots. 


  So, these were some things that we consider most important for you to look out for in a motherboard. These will help you make the best choice for the motherboard without compromising on getting quality performance.

          Besides [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/pk/), ASRock is another brand
          known for its quality manufacturing of hardware products, especially
          when talking about its motherboards; these are some of the best to buy
          to get unmatched performance from computers. With some amazing
          features and additions, this motherboard competes with every other
          popular motherboard in the market. 


          This motherboard comes with a Socket AM4 Digi Power design 9 Power Phase design with versatile support for various water cooling powers depending upon the system’s performance. Its Summit Ridge supports 95W Water Cooling, while Pinnacle Ridge and Raven Ridge supports 105W and 65W Water Cooling. This versatile support is not easy to find anywhere else in any other contemporary motherboard. 


          On the contrary, the **[ASUS TUF X570](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-TUF-X570-Plus-Motherboard-Lighting/dp/B07SXFK1TP?&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamingtechi09-20&linkId=59b6b4b64107c19596a8c79be6369d3f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)** motherboard lacks this crucial feature. The placement of cooling system headers is all in the wrong spots. As a result, you can’t achieve optimum cooling and system ventilation even if you install the most powerful coolers in it. So, if you are a fan of an excellent cooling system, I highly recommend the ASRock to you.


          Moreover, the motherboard comes pre-installed with an AMD Promontory B450 chipset, widely known for its performance and premium support. A motherboard with a B450 chipset is always preferred over conventional motherboards. It provides you with a great memory overclocking ability and many connectivity options that every PC user wants to have in their unit. 


          Additionally, the motherboard has 2x PCI-Express 2 0 x16 Slots, 2x PCI-Express 3 0 x16 Slots, and 1x PCI-Express 2 0 x1 Slot. These slots are helpful enough to upgrade your graphics card and sound cards, known as the most important parts of the PC build. Along with this, these slots exceptionally enhance the performance of your computer and is a suitable motherboard for heavier tasks most easily. 


          Furthermore, this motherboard also has a Hot Plug, SATA 4x SATA3 ports that help you connect several peripheral storage devices like hard drives and optical drives to your computer easily. This increased storage option is one of the best features that the motherboard comes with: it helps you save more of your files, games, and other data for a longer period without ever feeling any lag in the performance of your setup.


          When you buy this motherboard for your setup, know that you will be getting so much in a single unit that it will allow you to feel more satisfaction over whatever you have spent on buying it.

          Ending our list is this exceptionally performing motherboard that,
          just like any other high-quality motherboard on our list, has a
          combination of motherboard features that make it categorize among
          impressively performing motherboards worldwide. Besides its ability to
          support all heavy-duty tasks, it is most commonly known for its
          support of all the high-end games that most online gamers love to play
          in their free time. 


          This motherboard is just a perfect pair for the Ryzen 7 3700x as it comes with PCIe 4.0 and AMD AM4 Socket: things that are highly complementary to the Ryzen setup. Along with this, the mobo is designed to contain ultra-fast connectivity mainly because of the addition of 1Gb high ethernet speed, 1x PCIe 4. 0 x16 SafeSlot, Wireless connectivity (802. 11ax), USB ports with 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, dual M. 2 slots, D Sub & DVI and HDMI 2.1. 


          To help you get high performance through your setup without ever getting overheated while supporting some high-end tasks, the mobo is introduced as well-equipped with a chipset heat-sink, VRM heatsink, Fan Xpert 2 utility, and hybrid fan headers. These things combine to form the best-ever and most comprehensive cooling system that keeps the system cooler while buying to support your usage requirements.
