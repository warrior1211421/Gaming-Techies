  Randomly picking up a GPU for your build might cause many hazards for you in
  the longer run. You have to consider some features and things that make it
  rightly compatible with one CPU or the other.


  We suggest you consider the following in a GPU that you have eyed on for your Processor. consider


  ### Motherboard Compatibility


  The most important thing that you have to consider in a GPU is whether it is compatible with your motherboard. This is because; motherboard-GPU compatibility is a must for the effective performance of your computer.


  So, if you want to avoid any such thing happening to you, we suggest you first figure out what motherboard you have installed in your CPU and then go ahead to buy a GPU to make sure that it doesn’t block any useful **[PCIe slot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express)**


  When you step into the market for buying the GPU, you might get confused between the PCI 3.0 slot on the motherboard and the PCI 2.0 interface on the graphics card. However, as both of these are backward compatible.


  ### Casing Compatibility


  Another thing that we think is important for you t consider whether the GPU you are buying is compatible with your casing or not. This is important to consider because it may add additional beauty as well as better performance.


  You might want to consider; color manufacturing and the size of your GPU.and As far as the color of your GPU is concerned, if you are a look-conscious type of person, we suggest you get a GPU that looks great with your casing. It will add style and class to the outlook of your CPU.


  On the other hand, when we talk about making the GPU compatible with the casing in terms of size, you might face some trouble if you build an [ITX build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-ITX). However, when you are looking for a GPU for your m-ATX or ATX build, you will not face much trouble finding any.


  The reason for this is that because most of the graphics card comes pre-installed with two PCIe slots for their large-sized heatsinks, but for new generation cards, they have 3 PCIe slots. So, a bigger graphics card can never fit in a smaller casing unless you open it up or do some other trick to fit it inside.


  So, if you want yourself to get aside from all these additional troubles, you should consider buying a right-sized and right-color GPU for your casing.


  ### Ports


  The type of port you use greatly affects the resolution of the games you play so passionately. So, it is very important to consider which one you will have with your GPU.


  For example, get HDMI 1.0 port on your graphics card. You might not get the resolutions of up to 1440p or 4K because it is introduced with certain limitations to provide resolutions up to some extent only.


  While on the other hand, if you get an **[HDMI 1.4 port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI),** you will see it supporting both 4K and 1440p resolutions for your gaming.


  If your PC has enough power to support the 4K resolution with efficiency without any trouble or limitations, you need to buy a card that comes supporting the HDMI 2.0 interface. Besides this, you can also choose the graphics card that comes with Display Port 1.4 because it offers the same features, performance, and resolutions, just like HDMI 2.0.


  ### Power and Thermal Design


  The next thing that we want you to make sure about the graphics card you are buying is whether it offers a better price and performance than others. There are a lot of companies out there that you can examine to look out for such details,


  For instance, **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)** and **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)** only release chips or graphics cards. Still, third-party companies introduce several implementations to make them better than the original reference cards that the manufacturer releases. These implementations might include higher clock speeds and, above all, thermal solutions. This makes the cards work better to support all your heavy-profile operations.


  For example, in the case of graphics cards from AMD, XFX and Sapphire are leading in introducing the best thermal designs ever in its premium GPU. While on the other hand, Gigabyte and MSI gaming Geforce RTX series lead the game in the case of an NVIDIA graphics card. So, we suggest you look out for a graphics card that is the best performing.


  Note: It would be best for you in the long run if you buy a graphics card that that doesn’t demand greater power than your PSU can bear to provide.


  ### Budget


  Lastly, we suggest you take care of the budget you need to spend on buying the graphics card. Although a graphics card is an important component of your computer that you need to take great care of while buying, you don’t need to invest all of your money buying it.


  When you invest all of your money buying the best graphics card for your computer and leave behind all other components, it starts bottle-necking in your PC. However, this doesn’t mean you should buy the cheapest graphics card for your PC, as it provides your PC all the power to play games that are demanding.


  Another most important thing that we want to make you aware of is to make sure you d not spend too much money on highly overclocked aftermarket graphics cards as it is not enough to provide you the advantage you require from them.
