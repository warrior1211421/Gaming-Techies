  Randomly picking up a GPU for your build might cause many hazards for you in
  the longer run. You have to take into consideration some features and things
  that make it rightly compatible with one CPU or the other.


  Following are the things that we suggest you consider in a GPU that you have eyed on for your Processor.


  ### Motherboard Compatibility


  The most important thing that you have to consider in a GPU is that whether it is compatible with your motherboard or not. This is because; motherboard-GPU compatibility is a must for the effective performance of your computer.


  If you buy a GPU that is not compatible with your motherboard, whatever you are planning to do on your computer, gaming, video editing, graphic designing, or any other hard-drive demanding work, it will remain just a dream of yours.


  So, if you want to avoid any such thing happening to you, we suggest you first figure out what motherboard you have installed in your CPU and then go ahead to buy a GPU to make sure that it doesn’t block any useful [PCIe slot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express)


  When you step into the market for buying the GPU, you might get confused between the PCI 3.0 slot on the motherboard and the PCI 2.0 interface on the graphics card. However, in a real sense, you don’t actually have to worry about these things, as both of these are backward compatible.


  ### Casing Compatibility


  Another thing that we think is important for you to consider whether the GPU you are buying is compatible with your casing or not. This is important to consider because it may add additional beauty as well as better performance.


  There are two things that you might want to consider; color manufacturing and the size of your GPU. As far as the color of your GPU is concerned, if you are a look-conscious type of person, we suggest you get a GPU that looks great with your casing. It will add style and class to the outlook of your CPU.


  On the other hand, when we talk about making the GPU compatible with the casing in terms of size, you might face some trouble if you are building an [ITX build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-ITX). However, when you are looking for a GPU for your m-ATX or ATX build, you will not face much trouble finding any.


  The reason for this is that because most of the graphics card comes pre-installed with two PCIe slots for their large-sized heatsinks, but for new generation cards, they have 3 PCIe slots. So, a bigger graphics card can never fit in a smaller casing unless you open it up or do some other trick to fit it inside.


  So, if you want yourself to get aside from all these additional troubles, you should consider buying a right-sized and right-color GPU for your casing.


  ### Ports


  The type of port you use greatly affects the resolution of your games that you play so passionately. So, it is very important to consider which one you are going to have with your GPU.


  For example, if you get HDMI 1.0 port on your graphics card, you might not be able to get the resolutions of up to 1440p or 4K because it is introduced with certain limitations to provide resolutions up to some extent only.


  While on the other hand, if you get an [HDMI 1.4 port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI), you will see it supporting both 4K and 1440p resolutions for your gaming.


  If your PC has enough power to support the 4K resolution with efficiency without any trouble or limitations, you need to buy a card that comes supporting the HDMI 2.0 interface. Besides this, you can also go for making a choice for the graphics card that comes with Display Port 1.4 because it offers the same features, performance, and resolutions, just like HDMI 2.0.


  ### Power and Thermal Design


  The next thing that we want you to make sure about the graphics card that you are buying is that whether it offers a better price and performance than others or not. There are a lot of companies out there that you can examine to look out for such details,


  For instance, companies like [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) release the chips or graphics card only, but third-party companies introduce several implementations on them to make them better than the original reference cards that the manufacturer releases. These implementations might include better clock rates and, above all, thermal solutions. This makes the cards working better to support all your heavy-profile operations.


  For example, in the case of graphics cards from AMD, XFX and Sapphire are found to be leading in introducing the best thermal designs ever in its GPU. While on the other hand, Gigabyte and MSI lead the game in the case of an NVIDIA graphics card. So, we suggest you look out for a graphics card that is the best performing.


  **Note: It would be best for you in the long run if you buy a graphics card that that doesn’t demand greater power than your PSU can bear to provide.**


  ### Budget


  Lastly, we suggest you take care of the budget you need to spend on buying the graphics card. Although a graphics card is an important component of your computer that you need to take great care of while buying, you don’t need to invest all of your money buying it.


  When you invest all of your money buying the best graphics card for your computer and leave behind all other components, it starts bottlenecking in your PC. However, this doesn’t mean you should buy a “too cheap” graphics card for your PC, as it provides your PC all the power that your games demand.


  Another most important thing that we want to make you aware of is that make sure you d not spend too much money on highly overclocked aftermarket graphics cards as it is not enough to provide you the advantage that you require from them.

          When it comes to talking about getting the optimal performance from
          your Processor when you are running heavy-duty online games like Soul
          Calibur VI, Resident Evil 2, Destiny 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and
          many others, like this, then getting this GPU for it might work for
          you. This GPU comes forward with advanced features to provide you the
          performance of your choice.


          Along with Boost clock technology, the GPU has some other amazing features as well, which entirely captivate you to admire the manufacturing greatly. With these features, it has become one of the most used and recommended GPU for Ryzen 7 2700X.


          The thing which you are absolutely going to love about this GPU is that it comes with an advanced Boost Clock technology that increases the speed of your processor to almost 1875 MHz This increased speed positively affects your gaming experience.


          All heavy-profile games demand from you instant response time and perfect recognition of the opponent’s moves and actions. The speed you get by installing this GPU in your Processor is efficient enough to provide you with these things. The faster the speed, the better your performance goes.


          This is because the alternative of instant response and hearing is high speed. When your Processor lacks in this speed, there are chances that you might miss your opponent’s moves and actions and may not respond back. This might prove fatal for you as the thing can make you lose the overall game that you passionately started.


          So, for those of you who are facing this speed issue for some time, we suggest you consider installing this GPU in your Processor and get the best of whatever it can deliver to you. We are sure that you will feel amazed by its performance and efficient speed.
