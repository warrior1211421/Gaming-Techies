  - paragraph: Intel shook the entire gaming community with their new 8th gen
      i7-8700K processors. However, some users have reported that their
      motherboard doesn’t support the new processor or simply get the “No CPU
      found” error. In any case, you need to ensure that your favorite
      motherboard is fully compatible with 8th generation Intel processors
      before ordering one. This article will provide the available options you
      have for the **best motherboards for i7 8700k** and even higher.

  Intel Core i7-8700K is perhaps one of the most expandable processors ever. It
  has 6-cores, 12 threads, and a base frequency of 3.70 GHz. But that’s not the
  most impressive reason to buy the new Intel 8th gen. This processor supports
  up to 128GBs of RAM, and the integrated graphics chip Intel® UHD Graphics 630
  can expand up to 64GBs respectively. In short, Intel 8700K is surely the best
  thing that can ever happen to your gaming PC and your Workstation.


  All motherboard brands are reliable and durable. It is not right to provide a biased review just to make sales. However, every motherboard has a unique compatibility set, and you can truly get the max performance if you follow their guide. Therefore, you need to understand the capabilities as well as the compatibilities of any motherboard and compare it with your specs before actually buying it.

  When it comes to choosing the best motherboard for your setup, you have to
  look at every aspect to get the maximum output. The system can’t perform well
  unless the hardware specifications are supported at the max frequency.
  Moreover, incompatible motherboards provide a buggy experience most of the
  time. Here are a few factors that you should consider when choosing a
  motherboard:


  ### Processor Socket and Architecture:


  The processor socket determines whether or not your motherboard is compatible with your processor at the hardware level. You can choose from LGA, PGA, and BGA processor sockets. Most Intel Core processors use a version of LGA sockets due to the fast performance capabilities and better cooling options. Core i7-8700K uses an FCLGA1151 socket. Therefore, any motherboard that supports the 1151-1200 LGA is compatible with your processor.


  The processor’s architecture is another leading factor in determining compatibility. Not every motherboard is suitable for both AMD and Intel processors, i.e., they have different architectures. Intel processors utilize the Skylake architecture, whereas the AMD processors use AM4 architecture. Therefore, make sure to check the socket and architecture capabilities of the motherboard before choosing one.


  ### Form Factor:


  The motherboard comes in various sizes or form factors. You can choose from micro-ATX, mini-ATX, S-ATX, and E-ATX, respectively. Each form factor has its own possibilities and limitations. For instance, the E-ATX takes up more space, draws more power, and requires a heavy power supply while offering more ports and slots. Moreover, if you buy the PC case before choosing your motherboard, you don’t have much choice. It is because the size of the motherboard depends on whether or not your PC case is compatible with it. Other form factors include the size of the PSU, GPU, Cooling fans, Case fans, and AIO unit.


  ### RAM Speed:


  RAM speed plays a vital role in increasing or decreasing your system performance. According to benchmark results, a system that provides a 6215 score with a 2400MHz ram will provide a near 6300 score with a 2800MHz ram. However, the price difference between the different Ram speeds is significant. For instance, a 16GB ram with 2400MHz speed costs around 50$, the same ram will cost near 80$ with a 3200MHz speed. So you need to use a Ram with better speed for faster performance, right? No, your Ram speed is only useful if the motherboard supports that much speed. Otherwise, you will never unleash the true potential of your system.


  ### Multi-GPU:


  People just can’t get enough of the graphics and visual effects. For that purpose, you need a faster graphics card with every new game release. Not necessarily! You can use two same graphics cards to get double the performance that not even the latest GPU can provide. Therefore, if you are a tech-enthusiast, you should get a motherboard that provides multi-GPU support. Moreover, it is crucial to check whether your GPU is crossfire or SLI and if the motherboard is actually compatible with the multi-GPU architecture.  


  ### The Number of Slots:


  The motherboard has a modular structure with several slots of the different components. This structure makes it easier for you to replace and upgrade your components without any problem. Moreover, you can double the performance by keeping your previous components and adding new ones if they are compatible. So, what did you learn? You can double your performance with double components, which means you need extra slots in the motherboard. The PCI slots can be used for all sorts of upgrades from GPU to your sound and WIFI cards. Moreover, the M2 and SATA slots provide you the space to add several Terabytes of storage to your PC without compromising on the speed.


  ### Additional Features:


  It all comes down to the unique features that your motherboard will provide you. For example, some motherboards have built-in RGBs, while others have a powerful yet easy-to-understand BIOS. In any case, at least one of the unique features will surely attract you to the motherboard. Furthermore, some motherboards even offer built-in WIFI cards and Sound cards so that you don’t have to spend the extra money. All-in-all the additional features offered by any brand are provided to make your life easy and every purchase an intelligent one. You just have to consider what you want from the motherboard and start looking for the best suitable options.

      processor from the 8th generation. It provides a higher frequency that can
      play even the most demanding games. However, you need a compatible
      motherboard to unlock the true potential and avoid any computability
      issues. I hope this article has provided an in-depth review of the best
      motherboards for i7-8700K in 2021.
faqs:
  - answer: Intel Core i7-8700k uses LGA 1151 rev2 and Coffee Lake memory
      architecture. All the motherboards provided in this article are compatible
      with the Core i7 8th gen to Core i9 9th Gen processors.
    question: What Socket do I Need for Core i7 8700K?
  - question: Can I Play Heavy Games with Core i7-8700K?
    answer: Core i7 8700k is one of the most powerful processors of the 8th gen
      family. It provides an average 3.70 GHz frequency and a Turbo of 4.7 with
      still some head for overclocking. Therefore, i7-8700k is perfect for
      playing even the most demanding games of 2021 and later.
  - answer: You can’t compare the two processors because they are based on a
      completely different architecture. Still, in terms of performance, the
      Intel Core i7-8700K is pretty similar to AMD Ryzen 7 2700x except for a
      few differences.
    question: What is the AMD Equivalent of intel I7-8700K?
