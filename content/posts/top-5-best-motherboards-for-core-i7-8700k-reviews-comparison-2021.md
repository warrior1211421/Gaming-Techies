      i7-8700K processors. However, some users have reported that their
      motherboard doesn’t support the new processor or simply get the “No CPU
      found” error. In any case, you need to ensure that your favorite
      motherboard is fully compatible with 8th generation Intel processors
      before ordering one. This article will provide the available options you
      have for the **best motherboards for i7 8700k** and even higher.
after_intro: >-
  Intel Core i7-8700K is perhaps one of the most expandable processors ever. It
  has 6-cores, 12 threads, and a base frequency of 3.70 GHz. But that’s not the
  most impressive reason to buy the new Intel 8th gen. This processor supports
  up to 128GBs of RAM in four memory slots, and the integrated graphics chip
  Intel® UHD Graphics 630 can expand up to 64GBs respectively. In short, **Intel
  8700k** is surely the best thing that can ever happen to your gaming PC and
  your Workstation.


  All motherboard brands are reliable and durable. It is not right to provide a biased review just to make sales. However, every motherboard has a unique compatibility set, and you can truly get the max performance if you follow their guide. Therefore, you need to understand the capabilities as well as the compatibilities of any motherboard and compare it with your specs before actually buying it.

  When it comes to choosing the best motherboard for your setup, you have to
  look at every aspect to get the maximum output. The system can’t perform well
  unless the hardware specifications are supported at the max frequency.
  Moreover, incompatible motherboards provide a buggy experience most of the
  time. Here are a few factors that you should consider when choosing a
  motherboard:


  ### Processor Socket and Architecture:


  The processor socket determines whether or not your motherboard is compatible with your processor at the hardware level. You can choose from LGA, PGA, and BGA processor sockets. Most Intel Core processors use a version of LGA sockets due to the fast performance capabilities and better cooling options. Core i7 8700K uses an **[FCLGA1151 socket](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000027816/processors/intel-core-processors.html)**. Therefore, any motherboard that supports the 1151-1200 LGA is compatible with your processor.


  The processor’s architecture is another leading factor in determining compatibility. Not every motherboard is suitable for both AMD and Intel processors, i.e., they have different architectures. Intel processors utilize the Skylake architecture, whereas the AMD processors use AM4 architecture. Therefore, make sure to check the socket and architecture capabilities of the motherboard before choosing one.


  ### Form Factor:


  The motherboard comes in various sizes or form factors. You can choose from micro-ATX, S-ATX, and E-ATX, and mini ITX motherboard respectively. Each form factor has its own possibilities and limitations. For instance, the E-ATX takes up more space, draws more power, and requires a heavy power supply while offering more ports and slots. Moreover, if you buy the PC case before choosing your motherboard, you don’t have much choice. It is because the size of the motherboard depends on whether or not your PC case is compatible with it. Other form factors include the size of the PSU, GPU, Cooling fans, Case fans, and AIO unit.


  **Related: [Difference Between Micro ATX vs. Mini ITX vs. ATX](https://gamingtechies.com/micro-atx-vs-mini-atx-vs-atx/)**


  ### RAM Speed:


  RAM speed plays a vital role in increasing or decreasing your system performance. According to benchmark results, a system that provides a 6215 score with a 2400MHz ram will provide a near 6300 score with a 2800MHz ram. However, the price difference between the different Ram speeds is significant. For instance, a 16GB ram with 2400MHz speed costs around 50$, the same ram will cost near 80$ with a 3200MHz speed. So you need to use a Ram with better speed for faster performance, right? No, your Ram speed is only useful if the motherboard supports that much speed. Otherwise, you will never unleash the true potential of your gaming rig.


  ### Multi-GPU:


  People just can’t get enough of the graphics and visual effects. For that purpose, you need a faster graphics card with every new game release. Not necessarily! You can use two same graphics cards to get double the performance that not even the latest GPU can provide. Therefore, if you are a tech-enthusiast, you should get a motherboard that provides multi-GPU support. Moreover, it is crucial to check whether your GPU is crossfire or SLI and if the motherboard is actually compatible with the multi-GPU architecture.


  ### The Number of Slots:


  The motherboard has a modular structure with several slots of the different components. This structure makes it easier for you to replace and upgrade your components without any problem. Moreover, you can double the performance by keeping your previous components and adding new ones if they are compatible. So, what did you learn? You can double your performance with double components, which means you need extra slots in the motherboard. The PCI slots can be used for all sorts of upgrades from **[GPU](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-keep-gpu-cool/) (Keep your GPU cool)** to your sound and WIFI cards. Moreover, the M2 and SATA slots provide you the space to add several Terabytes of storage to your PC without compromising on the speed.


  ### Additional Features:


  It all comes down to the unique features that your motherboard will provide you. For example, some motherboards have onboard RGB, while others have a powerful yet easy-to-understand **[BIOS](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/)**. In any case, at least one of the unique features will surely attract you to the motherboard. Furthermore, some motherboards even offer built-in WIFI cards and Sound cards so that you don’t have to spend the extra money. All-in-all the additional features offered by any brand are provided to make your life easy and every purchase an intelligent one. You just have to consider what you want from the motherboard and start looking for the best suitable options.

          Gaming PRO Carbon AC remains at the top of the list for several
          reasons. It provides the most stable structure with a huge
          compatibility list for all products. This motherboard is for my
          personal use, and I am 100% satisfied with it. If you want the **best
          budget motherboard** without compromising on performance, then the
          Z390 Carbon AC will not fail to surprise you.


          One thing that I find quite attractive in this motherboard is its brilliant black color scheme. Black is one of the few universal colors that go well with almost every RGB customization. As a result, it feels like a bat-mobile that can become an inseparable part of every shadow. This feature alone gives the motherboard the upper hand over Gigabyte AORUS and several other similar motherboards. 


          The motherboard was released with the most powerful Core i9 in mind, and it became famous instantly. Everyone is inspired by the stability and BIOS support that this product provides.

          However, still, this motherboard has managed to beat almost all other
          motherboards except the same family. Moreover, the hero series offers
          much better elegance and several color options than the Strix
          motherboard. Therefore, if you are slightly short on budget to buy the
          Strix, you can still get almost similar features at a lower price.


          This motherboard belongs to the current pioneers of the market. You can achieve maximum performance from up to 11th Gen processors with this motherboard. So the 8700K compatibility isn’t going to be an issue even for future upgrades. However, the Core i9 processors may still require some **[BIOS](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/)** modding. In this regard, the MSI Carbon is still the favored motherboard. 


          Asus ROG tackles the compatibility problem by including a high-speed onboard WIFI chip. It is the only must-have feature missing from the former motherboard. Secondly, the Maximus XIII motherboard offers perfect ROG aesthetics in terms of elegance. For instance, you can connect all other ROG hardware to the motherboard for a synced RGB experience.


          Furthermore, this motherboard offers the same artificial intelligence frameworks as other Asus ROG Maximus motherboards. You can use the AI cooling feature with almost any AIO cooling system. Basically, this system works to provide maximum ventilation in the region where it is needed to conserve energy and maximize the cooling effect. Similarly, the AI noise cancellation ensures that the attached **[headphones](https://gamingtechies.com/best-openback-headphones/)** are automatically detected and optimized to provide a fully focused experience.
