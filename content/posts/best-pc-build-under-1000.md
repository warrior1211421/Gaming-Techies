          A power supply is unsurprisingly one of the most essential components
          within the PC build. It not only keeps your PC running at a consistent
          speed all the time but also makes it capable of supporting all types
          of online games. However, the condition to this is that it must be of
          high quality (which obviously this one by Cooler Master is). 


          Cooler Master is one of the leading brands in the hardware manufacturing market and is known for its quality production. This power supply by Cooler Master is exceptional in not only its performance but the design also. Following are some of its features that you must have a look at to consider for the purchase. 


          This power supply is made to deliver highly efficient performance as it comes 80 plus gold certification which means it has the minimum efficiency of 90% in performance. This is the most amazing feature of this power supply as the sole function of any power supply is to deliver the most power to the build; which this power supply is certified to do. 


          Additionally, the PSU comes with 2 3 EPS connectors that ensure the current generation compatibility with the motherboard. This PSU goes perfectly with the motherboard we have mentioned in our list as the features go in line with it most dominantly. 


          Furthermore, the PSU is made to contain high-temperature resilience as compared to all its predecessors. This temperature difference is almost close to 50 degrees Celsius in total and this is what makes the most efficient and advanced PSU of all. 


          Its fully modular flat black cables are introduced for increasing airflow, reducing clutter, and improving thermal performance and overall efficiency. The 120mm HDB hydro-dynamic fan that has the capability of creating less friction makes the PSUs performance go smoother and keeps the noise level down to keep the environment calm. 


          The 5-year warranty offer is great to keep you at ease with its purchase: you can return it any time when you feel it not meeting your requirements or lacking in performance. 


          The PSU is a great unit that keeps the functionality of the overall build at an enhanced level. Without installing this high-quality PSU, your PC build will remain incomplete and you will always find its performance lacking.
