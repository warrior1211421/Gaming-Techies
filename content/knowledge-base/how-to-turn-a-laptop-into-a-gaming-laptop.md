There is a massive difference between a gaming laptop and an ordinary one in the sense that a gaming laptop comes with upgraded and advanced features that are necessary to support various games. These are just the same as business or standard laptops, and their manufacturing makes all the difference. 

A gaming laptop comes with high speed, better graphics, huge memory, and also fast-processing power. All these things are considerably missing in an ordinary laptop, and thus it can’t support various games that you most often enjoy playing in your free time.

As it is already known that gaming laptops come with the most advanced features that are not found in those ordinary laptops. So, if you are thinking of converting your laptop into a gaming laptop, you might not be able to do it completely. 

This is because you might be able to change the hardware of your laptop completely in order to make it support various games that are introduced in present times. The most important components of a gaming laptop are probably the [motherboard](https://gamingtechies.com/best-x470-motherboard-for-2700x/) (Best motherboards for 2700x), processors, and also [graphics card](https://gamingtechies.com/best-gpu-for-ryzen-7-2700x/) (Graphic cards for Ryzen 7 2700x) that are surely not replaceable in any laptop model. 

Even if you manage to replace 1-2 parts, it still doesn’t work if you have some older version of the laptop with you with an older version of Intel HD Graphics processor, in place of a dedicated GPU which is not even able to run the games like Skyrim or Crysis. 

Buying a new laptop is the only solution for you if you really want to have a laptop that can support various games most efficiently. However, there are still some things that you can do to improve the gaming support of your laptop: 

1. Set the battery on high-performance mode 
2. Right-click on My Computer and move ahead to properties. Choose Advanced System Settings that are present on the left side. Move ahead to Advanced> Performance> Settings and then select the option of “Adjust for best performance.” This will adjust your system for maximum performance. 

   ***Note: This step is for [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7) users. If you have some different windows, you can use some other method that could help you do this for the OS.*** 
3. Before starting the game, close all the possible background processes. 
4. [Lower the in-game resolution](https://gamingtechies.com/how-to-keep-gpu-cool/) (Keep your GPU cool while gaming) to as much as it is possible for the gaming to support it. You can also turn off all the settings like Ambient Occlusion, Shadows, Anti-Aliasing, and also the FXAA to get better help. 
5. Update the drivers of your graphics to the latest ones that are introduced and available for your platform. 
6. All this will help you successfully get an extra 5-10 fps on a heavy game. You may get more for some older games that were introduced previously.
