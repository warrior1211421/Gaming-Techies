When you are buying any modem for gaming purposes, the first thing you have to keep in mind is its compatibility; make sure to check whether your new modem is compatible with the previous service provider that you are using or not. The reason for this is that to get the optimal performance, your modem must have to be compatible with your internet provider, and if it is not, also your money will be wasted, and your modem will not be able to provide the speedy internet connection that you need to have while playing your high-profile online games.

A brand new modem can easily make you save around $240-$280 over the course of the next 2-4 years, and if you go for renting a modem or buying a used one that, despite the fact that will cost you a much lesser price, but it can severely affect on the performance of the modem. You obviously wouldn't want to save money to get a modem that doesn't even provide you a stable connection for your gaming.
