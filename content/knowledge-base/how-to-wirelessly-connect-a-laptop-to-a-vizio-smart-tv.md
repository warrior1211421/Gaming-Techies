Do you know what’s better than your laptop’s 15-inch display? Your LED TV with a bigger screen, higher resolution, and better sound quality. Most gamers use their laptop for gaming, work, editing, and watching their favorite movies. In this regard, you can never have enough when it comes to the size of the display. However, buying a large HD display just for watching movies can be very expensive. Therefore, this article describes how you can connect your laptop to Vizio smart tv without any cables.

I have found multiple ways to connect your laptop to Vizio smart TV wirelessly. So let’s get started:

## Chromecast

Google Chromecast is a device that you plug into your TV’s HDMI port that needs to be powered by a USB cable.

You can use Chromecast to stream videos from services such as Netflix, HBO max, Twitch, Spotify, and many others. It is noteworthy that Vizio is the first smart TV to have the built-in feature of Google Chromecast in some models. 

Before we get started on the step-by-step guide, it would be best to check a few things:

* Make sure you have the latest version of Google Chrome on your laptop.
* Confirm whether your smart tv has a built-in Chromecast or not.
* If not, then you need to buy a Chromecast device separately. The [Google Chrome cast 3rd generation](https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00439-US-Chromecast-3rd-Generation/dp/B015UKRNGS) is the latest device available on Amazon.
* Plug the device into the HDMI port and connect the USB power cable.
* Finally, make sure that both the Chromecast and your laptop are connected to the same WIFI network.
* Now that you have fulfilled the preliminary requirements, let’s connect the laptop. Here’s how:
* Open your Chrome browser on your laptop (regardless of Windows or Mac).
* Select the three dots menu in the top right corner and look for the cast button.
* Click on the cast, and in the Dropdown Arrow, ⇒ select Cast Desktop
* Let it complete the search and select Vizio TV.

Now your laptop’s screen is automatically mirrored to the Vizio smart tv wirelessly.

## Airplay method

If you own an Apple laptop running Mac, you don’t need Chromecast or any other mirroring device.

Furthermore, the Apple Airplay is not limited to Google Chrome or any other application. It means that you can stream anything and everything from your laptop on your Vizio smart tv wirelessly.

* First of all, make sure that your model of Vizio smart tv is compatible with Airplay.
* Go to the TV’s home page using the remote control and look for the Airplay icon at the top menu bar.
* Your Smart tv supports Airplay if you see the icon in the menu bar.
* Otherwise, you are not eligible to use the Airplay method. It would be best to try some other method stated here.
* Secondly, make sure that both the MacBook and Vizio TV are on the same WIFI network.
* On your laptop, turn on Bluetooth and click on the Airplay icon.
* It is present in the top right corner next to the WIFI and volume button.
* Otherwise, you can simply search for Airplay from the Spotlight.
* Once you activate Airplay on both the TV and MacBook, the MacBook starts searching for available devices.
* Finally, select Vizio smart tv from the device list, and the streaming will start instantly.

This method is even compatible with IOS devices like iPhone and iPad.

## Wireless HDMI

What if I tell you that now you can connect to the HDMI port wirelessly using a straightforward method. It is more convenient as it lets you use the laptop from any distance and is very easy to set up.

The only thing you need for a wireless HDMI is:

* A wireless HDMI device: the [J-Tech Digital Wireless HDMI Dongle](https://www.amazon.com/J-Tech-Digital-Wireless-Passthrough-JTECH-WDEX-50M2/dp/B089X3PYHP) is the best wireless HDMI device available on Amazon:
* I personally use this device in both my home and office. It provides the highest 1080P display on my LED TV with a fantastic sound.
* The J-Tech wireless HDMI is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh machines and comes at a reasonable price.
* Finally, it allows you to connect from as far as 100 feet with consistent performance regardless of your distance from the device.

Now that you have the device, let’s get started with the wireless HDMI connection:

* Connect the HDMI input device to the HDMI port of your laptop.
* Connect the IR blaster to the input device and also the power cord.
* Make sure that the room is safe from external obstacles such as glass or other wireless devices.
* Next, connect the HDMI output device to the Vizio smart tv’s HDMI port.
* Plug in the power cable and also the IR receiver cable to the output device.
* That’s all you need for the one-time connection setup. From now on, whenever you need to use the HDMI connection:
* From the LED’s source menu, select HDMI 1 or 2.
* From the laptop, select the HDMI port as the output device.

## Conclusion

Gamers and streamers can just never get enough when it comes to screen size. Most of the time, you will use your PC or laptop for gaming and watching your favorite movies. So, it would be better if you could combine your laptop’s top-notch performance with the HD display of your home TV. So, how to connect your laptop to Vizio? This article explains it all.
