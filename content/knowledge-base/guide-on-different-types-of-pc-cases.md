The computer case is of the most important components of a PC. It saves your beloved system from the dangers of the harsh world. These cases come in many shapes and sizes. Each has its own set of pros and cons, but if picked wisely, it will best serve you. There are four many types of computer cases:

* **Full Tower (FT)**
* **Mid Tower (MT)**
* **Small Form Factor (SFF)**
* **Mini Tower**

All these cases are further classified as:

* **Open-air case**
* **Fully isolated case**
* **Semi-isolated case**

All these computer cases are perfect in their own way. Some are experts in saving space, while others keep your system easy to customize. PC case also plays an important role in keeping your machine at a cool temperature. This is accomplished by keeping the interior of the system ventilated.

In this article, I will be describing everything you need to know to choose the perfect computer case.

## Did you Know?

There is a 5th type of computer case known as the Super Tower case. It is mostly used by organizations and computer experts. These cases are so massive that you can fit two complete PC systems inside them. Normally, this case is classified as a full tower case.

## Full Tower Case (FT):- Best for Large Systems

![Full Tower Case](/uploads/full-tower-case.webp "Full Tower Case")

* **Height : 56cm**
* **Width, depth : variable**

**The Full Tower** is the largest case available in the market. This case is most suitable for high-end users. It can house multiple-GPUs and CPUs. Some models can even be housed with multiple motherboards. It is best for commercial use because you will be saving a lot of money and space. You can install both Intel and AMD motherboards in it. Both motherboards can then be accessed with the push of a button.

The full-sized tower case can house every type of motherboard. You can even install your supercomputer in such a casing because it can store multiple hard-drives. Hardware access won’t be a problem with this case as well. It is because space is allocated to each component, such as PSUs, GPUs, motherboards, HDDs, SSDs, and all others. Therefore, you don’t have to disturb other hardware when accessing only a single one.

The airflow of these cases is the best. You don’t have to worry about providing external cooling pads for average use. However, if your system is sure to produce a lot of heat, you have the option to install external cooling fans due to designated spaces for them. Some cases even come with built-in exhaust fans. You even have the housing space of a full liquid cooling system. Even the radiator can be stored in this case.

Cable management is not a problem as well. You can easily fit all the cables you need in this PC case. All the components have designated spaces, so you don’t have to worry about making any alterations. The only drawback of a full-tower case is that they are not mobile at all. You can damage the system if you move it a lot after fitting. Another factor is the price. The price of a full-tower is higher than other models. I suggest that you should consider your space requirements before choosing to buy this case.

**Here are the best three Full Tower cases:**

* **Corsair 1000D**
* **Cooler Master Cosmos C700P**
* **Thermaltake View 71**

### Corsair 1000D

![Corsair 1000D](https://gamingtechies.com/img/corsair-1000d.webp "Corsair 1000D")

The first PC case in the list comes from a very well-known manufacturer. Corsair is a firm that requires no introduction. They have been making the perfect PC accessories for almost a decade now. The 1000D is classified as a Super Tower case. It has the housing space for any crazy build that you throw at it. It can house two ATX sized motherboards simultaneously. You don’t have to worry about the cooling system because it comes pre-fitted with two exhaust fans at the front. They help increase the rig’s air intake to make it remain thermally stable even at high usage loads.

### Cooler Master Cosmos C700P

![Cooler Master Cosmos C700P](https://gamingtechies.com/img/cooler-master-cosmos-c700p.webp "Cooler Master Cosmos C700P")

C700P is the next generation of the notorious Cosmos PC case. It has the same price tag as its predecessor but comes packed with many modern features. it supports all motherboards’ sizes. You can install micro-ATX to E-ATX in this case without the need to make alterations. It comes pre-installed with RGB strips on both the bottom and top ends. It makes the PC look more elegant and powerful. It can house up to two separate systems and a liquid cooling radiator. You can install full sized Multiple-GPUs with proper cooling. The only drawback to this pc case is that you have to perform cable management manually. However, it is expected to be included in later editions to the PC case.

### Thermaltake View 71

![Thermaltake View 71](https://gamingtechies.com/img/thermaltake-view-71.webp "Thermaltake View 71")

The view 71 is the best full-tower-sized PC case available on the market. It can house any sized motherboard, i.e., Mini ITX, Micro ATX, ATX, and even the E-ATX. You can even install an ATX and Mini-ATX at the same time in this case. Just a single HDMI can access both systems. You can even toggle multi-display to access both systems simultaneously. This case has a self-weight of 18.9Kgs. So, you have to designate a separate space for this system because it isn’t portable.

## Mid Tower (MT):- Best for Airflow

![Mid Tower](https://gamingtechies.com/img/mid-tower-case.webp "Mid Tower")

The MT is pretty similar to full-tower PC cases. They have almost the same features but comes in a very portable size. These cases are perfect if you enjoy Lan party sessions with your buds. These cases have HDDs and SSDs built-in bays. You can install the standard sized HDDs without having to make alterations. These bays are modular, which means that they can be removed when not used to make room for other components. These cases are perfect for home users because they occupy less space and can be carried around under your arms.

The only drawback to this case is that it can’t house full-sized graphic cards or GPUs. You may need to remove HDD bays to make room for this component. Similarly, only a limited range of PSUs can be installed to this system without alterations. You can’t install multiple systems, i.e., multi-motherboards, to these cases due to space limitations.

**The Top Three MT Cases are as Follows:**

* **Corsair 4000D Airflow**
* **NZXT H510 Elite**
* **Phanteks Eclipse P300A**

### Corsair 4000D

![Corsair 4000D](https://gamingtechies.com/img/corsair-4000d.webp "Corsair 4000D")

The 4000D is a mid-ranged PC case. It follows the principle to remain modest in its display but maintain the best quality. It doesn’t come included with pre-installed RGBs, but they can be added to external accessories. It is the only PC case with motherboard combability from E-ATX to ITX sizes. You can install full-sized multiple-GPUs in this unit without alterations.

This case is best suitable for optimum airflow. It comes with two exhaust fans that can rotate at 120 RPM. If this isn’t enough, you always have the option to install extra cooling fans and liquid cooling systems. It has dedicated housing for cooling radiators, so you don’t have to worry about space.

Multiple storage devices can be installed with this PC case. You can house up to two SATA and two M2 SSDs. Besides, it even has PCIe support for your different storage devices. These housing bays are modular and can be detached when not in use. It helps in creating a better cooling performance in terms of airflow. The cable management for this unit is also very suitable because it is an open-air case. You can manage your cables by passing them through the allocated spaces.

### NZXT H510 Elite

![NZXT H510 Elite](https://gamingtechies.com/img/nzxt-h510-elite.webp "NZXT H510 Elite")

The best see-through PC case on the whole list! It has the ability to house the biggest components that you can mount. Suppose you are planning to devote a lot of cash and time to your PC built. You should probably show it off in front of your fellows. The H510 allows you to install the hardware in any orientation you like. Thanks to its multi-point mounting technology.

You can install any sized motherboard from E-ATX to micro ITX in this case. It has tons of features just waiting to be discovered and utilized by you. It is the only MT case in the list to have support for E-ATX and multiple graphics cards at the same time. You can even install multiple storage devices to this unit without the need for alterations. The only drawback is that it can’t house multiple-motherboards simultaneously. Also, it is a premium PC case, so you should expect a high price range. If money isn’t an issue, you should consider purchasing this limited-edition, see-through and open-air PC case.

### Phanteks Eclipse P300A

![Phanteks Eclipse P300A](https://gamingtechies.com/img/phanteks-eclipse-p300a.webp "Phanteks Eclipse P300A")

The P300A is the best-budget PC case in the market. It has fewer features than the above-stated models. But the features and quality are worth the amount of money spent. If you have a limited budget, then you should consider this unit over any other. It has the best airflow and cooling system in the whole industry. It comes with a built-in exhaust fan in the rear end and a mesh door at the front. This mesh can be used as natural exhaust components as well as for directing airflow towards the cooling radiator.

It can house any average-sized motherboard without having to make any alterations. You can install two SSDs and two slow speed HDDs in their allocated housings. You can even install a cooling radiator and RGB strips inside the casing. The only drawback is that you can’t install a full-sized GPU without removing the HDD trays. It is a semi-open-air case, which means you should expect a balance between space and airflow.

## Small Form Factor (SFF)

Suppose you are building a gaming rig but have limited space in your room. You have the option to either wall-mount your system and make it fully open-air. But such a system is always at the risk of being dust damaged. The other option is to try the SFF PC cases. These cases are perfect for small-sized setups because they don’t require any large spacing.

You can install any mini-ITX or smaller sized motherboard in an SFF case due to its limited housing. It can’t hold any full-sized graphics cards or CPUs or even the average HDDs. Installing such components is a very tricky business and should be attempted only by professionals. The good thing is that even with such compacted spacing, it offers perfect airflow ventilation. Though they don’t come pre-installed with exhaust fans, you can always include an external system to boost those temperature ratings. These systems can be easily carried from one place to another due to their lightweight. Therefore, SFF can be considered to be a portable case with high mobility. You can install an SFF case in any orientation that you like.

**The top three SFF cases are as follows:**

* Thermaltake Core P1
* NZXT H200i
* Corsair Carbide 200R Compact ATX Case

### Thermaltake Core P1

![Thermaltake Core P1](https://gamingtechies.com/img/thermaltake-core1.webp "Thermaltake Core P1")

The P1 is the best case for Mini-ATX or smaller motherboards. It is perfect if you plan to build a compact or mini gaming PC because it has the perfect balance between compact size and airflow. If you require further airflow, you can install two external cooling fans to the front of the case. You even have the option to include cooling radiators, but the equipment needs to be placed outside the case.

Don’t be fooled by its small size because it has all the features of a full-sized open-air PC case. It has plenty of room for your expensive gaming hardware in its limited space. You can install RGBs and high RPM cooling fans without any hassle. It can even house PSUs up to 500W in the allocated space. However, once the build is finished, you can’t easily access individual components without disturbing others.

This case has the combability to house most of the modern hardware without requiring any alterations. The only drawback is that you can’t install multiple-GPUs or CPUs. Due to lack of spacing for such hardware. If you attempt to alter the case, you may end up losing its functionality.

### NZXT H200i

![NZXT H200i](https://gamingtechies.com/img/nzxt-h200i.webp "NZXT H200i")

 The H200i is the best simple case with a lot of power hidden inside. Suppose you are on a tight budget and space requirements. It would be best if you considered this case over any other. It doesn’t have any of the premium designing or RGBs included, but it does have the support of almost any motherboard inside. You can even install a full-sized GPU in this case without alterations.

This case can be mounted on top of your desk or even on the wall. It will increase the beauty of your setup by a factor of at least three. The side is fitted with tempered glass, which makes this PC case semi-open-air. You can see through the case if installed with proper RGB lighting. The best part is that it can house multiple storage devices, so you don’t have to worry about buying any caddy drives.

### Corsair Carbide 200R Compact ATX Case

![Corsair Carbide 200R](https://gamingtechies.com/img/corsair-carbide-200r-compact-atx-case.webp "Corsair Carbide 200R")

When making the transition from MT to SFF cases, the Carbide 200R comes at the boundary of both cases. It has the compaction of a mini-ATX case but the airflow and compatibility of an MT case. Overall, it is a beast of a case. It can be mounted with up to six 120mm cooling fans along with a liquid cooling radiator.

This case is pretty heavy in terms of weight, but the amazing performance and features make up for this drawback. Suppose you are looking for a reliable PC case at a reasonable price. The 200R is your dream PC case. It even has a single transparent side to compete with all the modern PC cases.

## Mini Tower PC Case

![Mini Tower PC Case](https://gamingtechies.com/img/mini-tower-pc-case.webp "Mini Tower PC Case")

The Mini tower PC case is slightly smaller than the MT case but larger than the SFF case. You can consider them as vertical SFF cases due to their highly compacted housing system; it is best for home-based extra pc mainly used for browsing the internet or for office use. If you are building a system on a very tight budget, this can be your dream case. It has compatibility for Mini-ATX boards and micro-ITX boards.

It should be noted that you can’t install any full-sized equipment in this PC case, which means that you have to consider the dimensions before purchasing the hardware manually. The best way to accomplish this task is to take the PC case with you to the tech store and try out every component individually. This will save you a lot of time and effort. I have personally seen full-sized hardware mounted inside Mini Tower PC case, but overall, it is a very tricky business.

These are the top three Mini Tower PC case:

* Cooler Master N200
* Thermaltake Versa H17
* Antec VSK3000E

## Conclusion

The PC case is one of the most important components during PC build. It provides limits in terms of the hardware capability of your gaming system. There are four main categories of PC cases that you can choose from.

I hope that this article has helped you choose your perfect type of PC case according to your budget and space requirements.
