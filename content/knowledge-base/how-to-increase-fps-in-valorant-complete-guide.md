Valorant is perhaps the most popular multiplayer shooter game for 2021-22. It seems that the game is quickly taking over the market share of previous mainstream games like CS: GO. As a result, a large number of CS players are gradually shifting to the new platform. However, frames per second are among the common issues these new players face. For instance, the counter strike is relatively less resource-consuming than Valorant. 

The good news is that you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars in system hardware upgradation; all you need is to optimize the in-game settings. So, how to increase fps in Valorant? Well, this guide will surely help you boost your gameplay. 

## What is FPS?

FPS is the acronym for framer per second. It is the number of frames that your computer can process and display on the monitor in one second. FPS depends on several factors like system specifications, hardware compatibility, monitor frame rate, and system optimization. Moreover, all these factors are correlated, and you can't expect maximum output from a single change. 

In most cases, fps drop is due to the un-optimized settings of the game. It means that your computer isn't working at its best to process maximum system resources in one second. 

### Why Does the FPS Matter in Valorant?

Valorant is among the fast-paced first-person shooters that require quick judgment. Yes, our eyes can process far more FPS than the conventional 60Hz that most generic monitors offer. More FPS means that you get a few extra seconds to judge the situation, process the information, and make timely decisions. 

Furthermore, sometimes the game is a few microseconds behind the actual gameplay. So, it increases your chances of a missed shot in tight situations, especially when sniping. Therefore, it is best to utilize the maximum amount of frames that your system can process to enhance your gameplay experience. 

## System Specifications

Valorant is based on an optimized framework that doesn't consume as much system resources. However, the game is optimized for certain hardware, and a high-end PC doesn't guarantee maximum output. Therefore, it is best to understand the minimum and recommended system specifications before installing the game on your computer. 

### **Minimum Requirements**

**Processor:** Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3.0GHz / AMD Phenom 8750 Triple-Core

**Graphics:** AMD Intel HD Graphics 3000 Desktop or NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT

**VRAM:** 1000MB

**System Memory:** 4 GB RAM

### Recommended Requirements

**Processor:** Intel Core i3-4150 3.5GHz / AMD FX-6100

**Graphics:** AMD Radeon R5 240 v1 or NVIDIA GeForce GT 730

**VRAM:** 1000MB

**System Memory:** 4 GB RAM

The good thing about online multiplayer games is that you don't need a high-end PC to play like a pro. In most cases, you must prioritize FPS over graphics and visual enhancements. As a result, your system will have plenty of resources to process the game information and keep you ahead of your competitors. Here are a few adjustments that will surely boost your FPS in Valorant:

### Recommended System Settings

* **Vignette – Off**
* **Material Quality – Low**
* **Improve Clarity – Off**
* **Limit FPS – Unlimited**
* **Bloom – Off**
* **Detail Quality – Low**
* **Texture Quality – Low**
* **VSync – Off**
* **Anti-Aliasing – None**
* **First Person Shadows – Off**
* **Anisotropic Filtering – 8x/4x**
* **Display Mode – Fullscreen**
* **UI Quality – Low**
* **Distortion – Off**

## **Disable in-game Overlays**

Overwolf overlays are the biggest reason for FPS drop in gameplays. A single unimportant notification can consume the system resources, leading to a quick FPS drop. The problem is that a microsecond delay can completely change the course of the round. Therefore, it is important to always stay on top of things to maximize your chances of winning the game. In-game overlays like Discord, Twitch, Nvidia, and AMD overlays can seriously affect your FPS performance. 

Therefore, turning off all unnecessary game overlays is important before starting a game. However, some of these overlays, like Discord, are important for an enhanced gameplay experience. For instance, it is good to know who you are talking to when playing a game. In that case, you can optimize your system performance by marking your status as busy and turning off the communication with non-playing friends. Similarly, you can further boost your Valorant FPS by disabling the text chat notifications from the settings. 

## Set the Graphics to Low

Have you ever wondered why the Top players like Shazam play on low graphics despite having high-end computer hardware? The main reason is that graphics are the least important in competitive games like Valorant. Instead, you can optimize your system to use those precious resources in processing the FPS faster. 

Firstly, all the visual quality settings must be set to low. It won't alter your gameplay, and you will notice a boost in your game performance. Start with the basic settings like texture, material, detail, and UI quality: set all of them as low or medium. Secondly, disable the game overlays like Vignette, Anti-Aliasing, and clarity. Lastly, you can further boost your gameplay by toggling unlimited FPS in the settings. Also, avoid using maximum display resolution. It will magnify the game screen slightly and double your frames per second performance. 

## **Conclusion**

Valorant is currently the mainstream competitive game with numerous players. Almost 70% of CS: GO players have shifted to the new platform, and others will come eventually. However, some of these new players often face FPS drop issues right in their first round. The good news is you don't need to upgrade the system as long as it meets the game's system requirements. So, how to increase FPS in Valorant? This article provides all the possible optimization to save your time and money.
