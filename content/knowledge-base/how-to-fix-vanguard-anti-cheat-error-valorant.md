Valorant is undoubtedly the biggest multiplayer shooter of 2021-22. The game is universally praised by almost everyone who has played it for a few days. Some players even say that it is the perfect combination of CS: GO and League of Legends. Furthermore, Valorant offers several protective measures that protect the security integrity by preventing any cheating by the players. For instance, the game is powered by a state-of-the-art Vanguard anti-cheat system with minimum exploits worldwide. 

The game requires a Vanguard service to run in the background to function correctly. Otherwise, the players won’t be connected to the servers. However, sometimes the system faces troubles which leaves the players unable to launch the game. In the past few days, several people have reported the Vanguard Anti-cheat error in Valorant. There are a number of reasons for this problem, and the best way to solve it is to apply one fix at a time to restore the game functionality. Therefore, this article provides all the possible fixes to the problem so that you can get back from AFK in no time.

## What is Vanguard Anti-cheat?

Vanguard is a compulsory service program for Valorant. The game relies on this special anti-cheat engine to prevent cheaters from using wallhacks and aimbots. However, if the game encounters any tempering with the engine or if it stops functioning correctly, the game doesn’t connect to the servers at all. As a result, people encounter different errors like failed to initialize, error code 200, or the anti-cheat engine error. 

Fortunately, people who don’t cheat in gaming have found a couple of ways to solve these problems. The first and most useful way is to restart the service and reconnect it to the game servers. This article will discuss all these possible game fixes to help you diagnose and troubleshoot the error without any professional help.

## Restart the Vanguard service

* Close the Valorant game from the task manager if it stops responding.
* Press Win + X and select task manager from the list.
* Find Valorant, right-click on it, and select end process from the menu.
* Next, expand the taskbar by clicking on the Show hidden icons on the bottom right end of your screen.
* Right-click on Riot client and click on exit.
* Similarly, close the Vanguard application by repeating the same process.
* Finally, restart your computer and try launching Valorant from the desktop icon.

## Disable Antivirus

Most probably, the previous method will fix your Vanguard error. However, if you still can’t launch the game, don’t worry. Sometimes, a third-party antivirus program like Avast or Avira blocks Vanguard from launching. Moreover, even the Windows Security Center or Windows Defender blocks the Vanguard client. So, allowing the program from the antivirus or disabling your antivirus will fix the problem.

* Show hidden icons from the taskbar.
* Alternatively, you can also access the security settings from your PC settings.
* Press the Win button and choose the settings icon to launch the setting app.
* Open security settings from the menus to open Windows Security Center.
* Choose virus and threat protection from the menu.
* Click on protection history and locate Vanguard, Valorant, or any other app related to the game.
* Expand the blocked application, allow administrator, and select allow on the device from the drop-down menu.
* Similarly, you can also disable the antivirus program if you are using any third-party software.

## Bypass Windows Firewall

Windows firewall is a special program designed to prevent any suspicious application from accessing the internet. Usually, it works well only to block malicious programs. However, sometimes the program recognizes Vanguard as a threat and blocks it in the firewall. To allow Valorant from the Windows firewall, follow these steps:

* Press the Windows button and search for Control Panel.
* Click on View by settings and choose small or large icons from the drop menu.
* Locate and open Windows Defender Firewall.
* Choose Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall. Then, click Change settings.
* Select allow another app from the menu and browse for Valorant.
* Usually, the game is installed in C:\Program Files\Riot Vanguard\Valorant.exe.
* However, if you chose a different installation directory, open it from there.
* Click Add button and tick the private and public boxes.
* Similarly, again click on allow another app, click browse, and open C:\Program Files\Riot Vanguard\vgc.exe.
* Click Add button and tick the private and public boxes.
* Finally, again, choose to allow another app and browse for Riot Client services.
* Click Add button and tick the private and public boxes.

## Reinstall Vanguard

The last resort to fixing all Vanguard errors is uninstalling and reinstalling the client. However, it doesn’t mean that you must download the whole 8 GB game data again. All you need is to uninstall the Vanguard client and launch the Riot client.

* The game will detect the missing Vanguard system and reinstall it automatically.
* Open the Windows Settings app from the Windows start menu.
* Click on the Apps menu and choose apps & features from the left side of the screen.
* Keep scrolling down till you find the Vanguard app.
* Click on the Vanguard icon and choose to uninstall the app from the menu.
* Next, restart your PC to finish the process.
* After restart, launch Riot Client from the desktop icon and wait for it to detect the missing Vanguard client.
* The game will then start downloading and reinstalling the Vanguard client.
* The file is less than 200MBs, so it will only take a couple of minutes depending on your internet connection.
* After installation, all your Vanguard-related problems will be solved, and you can play the game as normal.
