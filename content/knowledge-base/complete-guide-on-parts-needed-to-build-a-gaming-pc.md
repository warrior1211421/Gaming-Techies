The main reason why people prefer a gaming PC over a console is customizability and attention to detail. However, pre-built gaming PCs take away your freedom by providing everything pre-installed in the setup. Moreover, pre-built gaming PCs are more expensive than building a gaming PC yourself.

The **[PC Case](https://gamingtechies.com/best-open-air-pc-case/)** is the first in every list of PC components. All your special hardware is stored and assembled in the case. Moreover, the PC case is also responsible for the protection of the hardware along with proper ventilation. However, some PC cases are designed in such a way that only selected hardware can fit in them. For instance, an E-ATX motherboard or a large PSU can’t fit in a small ATX PC case.

Therefore, it is important to check the size and compatibility of your hardware before choosing the **[PC case for your gaming build](https://gamingtechies.com/types-of-pc-cases/) (Types of PC Cases)**. Moreover, modern PCs have to look beautiful to display their power. So, an extra see-through side of the PC case and some RGBs will only add to the beauty and popularity of your build.

### Motherboard

![Motherboard](/uploads/motherboard.webp "Motherboard")

A motherboard is the most important component of any PC build. All your hardware is powered and controlled by the motherboard. So, it is important to check whether or not all the components are compatible with the motherboard. For example, **[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html)** and **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)** processors have different sockets and chip technology. Intel processors use LGA-type processor sockets, while the AM4 architecture is suitable for AMD or Ryzen processors. 

Similarly, some motherboards support Crossfire technology for **[AMD GPUs](https://gamingtechies.com/best-gpu-for-ryzen-7-2700x/)**, and Nvidia graphics cards require SLI technology for a dual-GPU setup. Similarly, some motherboards support overclocking as they have advanced power control and temperature management systems. In short, it is best to check the compatibility of each PC part before ordering a motherboard.  

### Power Supply (PSU)

![Power Supply](/uploads/power-supply.webp "Power Supply")

A power supply unit or PSU is yet another crucial element that defines the power of your gaming PC. It is the component that provides the optimum power supply to all your PC components. Thus, it prevents any of the system components from being underpowered or overpowered at any instance. Nothing in your system will work unless you have a suitable power supply installed on the computer. 

The maximum power output of your PSU is measured in Watts. Therefore, it is best to calculate the power requirements of all your PC components before purchasing a power supply. Usually, a 550W to 650W power supply is more than sufficient for powering a dual-GPU modern gaming PC.

### Processor

![Processor](/uploads/processor.webp "Processor")

A processor or CPU is the brain of any computer. It calculates and processes all the information that your gaming PC needs to function. The power of a processor is measured in MHz or GHz. Modern processors like the **[Intel Core i7](https://gamingtechies.com/best-motherboards-for-core-i7-8700k/)** **(Best Motherboard for Core i7 8700k)** or AMD Ryzen 9 have the highest processing power. However, different processors require different sockets to fit and function correctly. In this regard, Intel processors use LGA architecture, and AMD processors use an AM4 architecture. In any case, it is important to know which socket is supported by your motherboard, along with the maximum processing power that you will need for the games. 

### RAM

![RAM](/uploads/ram.webp "RAM")

Random Access Memory or RAM is a short-term, high-speed memory of the PC. It temporarily stores all the vital information that your PC needs to function. The more system memory you have, the faster your PC will function. So, it won’t be wrong to say the RAM is yet another one of the important **parts needed to build a gaming PC.** Moreover, the data transfer rate of the RAM is as important as its storage capacity.

Therefore, it would be wise to consider both these factors and the DDR3 or DDR4 technology of the memory. Lastly, most gaming RAMs have built-in RGBs that enhance the aesthetics of your gaming PC.

### Storage

![Storage](/uploads/storage.webp "Storage")

A PC storage is very different from RAM. For instance, the RAM is a short-term memory that only the system can access. On the contrary, system storage devices like HDD and SSD drives are user storage devices that both user and the system can view. 

The data transfer speed of the storage greatly speeds up the read/write speed of your system, thus making it incredibly fast. Nowadays, most gaming PCs use a combination of SSDs and HDDs. The SSD is used for high-speed data access like the Operating system and gaming.

At the same time, HDD is used to store everything else on your computer. In most cases, a 256-GBs SSD and a 1-2TB HDD are more than enough to store all your important data.

### Graphics Card

![Graphics Card](/uploads/graphic-card.webp "Graphics Card")

Graphics card or Graphics Processing Unit GPU is gradually becoming the most important component of any gaming PC build. It is the device responsible for processing and displaying the visual data on your monitor. High-storage and fast speed is the to any successful GPU.

Moreover, different cards are designed to enhance the usability of different tasks. For instance, the Nvidia GTX or RTX series is specially designed for gaming and entertainment. Similarly, the Nvidia Quadro series is best suitable for designing and rendering. In any case, it is important to know your requirements before choosing a modern graphics card like the new RTX 3090.

### CPU Cooler

![CPU Cooler](/uploads/cpu-cooler.webp "CPU Cooler")

CPU and other components of your gaming PC generate an immense amount of heat. The components cease to function properly if they overheat. Therefore, you need a good cooling system along with adequate airflow throughout the CPU. In this regard, you need a series of cooling fans to push hot air out of the system and bring in fresh, cold air.

Similarly, modern gaming PCs use a water cooling system that radiates heat away from the system to make it cool. A properly cooled gaming PC functions faster and is much more stable than others. So, it is best to calculate the maximum heat output of your system and design a system cooling system accordingly. Moreover, some cooling fans have built-in RGBs that you can control with a remote or via a smartphone app. 

## Conclusion

Gaming PCs are more popular than gaming consoles as they are customizable, upgradeable, and can play several AAA titles. However, it is best to build a gaming PC yourself rather than buy a pre-built PC. It is much expensive, and you don’t have control over what goes into the build. Therefore, this article provides a detailed description of all the **parts needed to build a gaming PC**; I hope you find it useful and interesting.
