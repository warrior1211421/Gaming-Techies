Nowadays, many people are interested in building their own PC rather than purchasing a pre-built unit. The main reason is that standard computers don't offer much room for customization and you have to pay a lot for making simple upgrades.

However, assembling a PC goes far beyond installing major components like rams, GPUs, and SSDs. For example, something as small as a power button can be very time-consuming if you don't have the proper guidelines. So, this article is perfect for you if you want to know how to connect the power button to the motherboard.

## Locate the Terminals

A motherboard is a complex unit with several ports for the various pc components. For instance, there are two types of connectors on a motherboard namely: 8-pin terminals and 24-pin terminals. The power button is connected to the 8-pin connector. Moreover, the button won't function if you accidentally connect it to a 24-pin terminal. Therefore, it is important that you first locate the different terminals on the board.

For this purpose, you must disassemble your computer when repairing the power button. However, if it is a new PC, you can find the terminals just by turning over the motherboard. The terminals are labeled as 8-pin and 24-pin at the back of the motherboard. So, you won't face any issues in finding them. 

## Difference Between 8-pin and 24-pin Terminals

The different terminals can be very confusing, especially for new users. They are almost identical, but each serves a different purpose on the system.

### 8-pin terminals

The 8-pin terminal is a simple socket that serves only one purpose. The terminal conveys power from the PSU to your motherboard through the power button. The terminal is usually located at the header of the motherboard. All you need is to connect the power button cord to the terminal and you are good to go.

### 24-pin terminals

The 24-pin terminals are the main deal that powers all the different components of your computer. For instance, the processor, graphics card, ram, etc, everything gets its power from a 24-pin terminal. In contrast to older computers with 20-pin terminals, the newer computer generations use a 24-pin terminal to provide extra power. However, you can still use a 24-pin terminal on an older 20-pin motherboard, but it doesn't work the other way around.

## How to Connect the Power Button to the Motherboard?

Connecting the power button to your motherboard can be a fairly simple job if you know what you are doing. Here, I will help you by offering a step by step guide:

### Find the F-panel

The 8-pin terminal is usually labeled as F-panel in all motherboards. This is the portion that powers the various functions like power on/off, led indicators, and power reset. You can easily find the 8-pin connectors by consulting the motherboard manual. In case you don't have a manual, the F-panel terminals can be found at the bottom right corner of the motherboard.

### Prepare the Button

Usually, all the power jumpers are shipped with the motherboard. However, all of them serve different purposes and are labeled likewise. For instance, if your motherboard has a reset button, it is labeled as Reset SW and so on. In this regard, you are looking for a power jumper that says Power SW. You can check the power switches as they have 8 holes that perfectly fit in the 8-pin terminal.

### Connect the Button

Before you proceed any further, it is recommended to disconnect all power cables from the computer. It saves you from the hazard of being electrocuted during the process. Once the motherboard is ready, install the power button in the casing and carefully connect the power button cord to the F-panel. Moreover, it is a good idea to gently press the connection to avoid any loose ports. If the computer still doesn't turn on, you may have connected the power button to the wrong port. Don't worry, you can still fix it by swapping the 8-pin terminals.

### Assemble the Computer

Once you are satisfied with the job, it is time to proceed with your build. Install all the remaining pc components on the motherboard, close the casing and connect all the cables. Press the power button to turn on your computer and enjoy gaming. Moreover, you need to install a fresh copy of Windows if it is your first time turning on the computer.

## How to Turn on a Computer without a Power Button?

Sometimes, the computer stops turning on all of a sudden. Well, it causes panic in most users as they think that the damage will cost them a lot. However, in most cases, it is just a broken power button. You need to turn on the computer without a power button to confirm your diagnosis. In this regard, the job is very simple if you have some technical knowledge about computer hardware.

The power button serves as a jumper that connects the two 8-pin terminals when you press it. You can replicate the same process by using a metal pin or a screwdriver to connect the two pins. If the computer turns on as soon as you connect the two pins, it is a power button issue. Otherwise, it is best to get your computer checked by a professional for further diagnosis.

## Conclusion

Building your gaming PC is a fun DIY project if you know what you are doing. Fortunately, most PC components like the motherboard come with an instructional manual to help you all the way through. However, sometimes you need some extra help when connecting the smaller parts like a power button. Therefore, this article will help you out with how to connect a power button to the motherboard
