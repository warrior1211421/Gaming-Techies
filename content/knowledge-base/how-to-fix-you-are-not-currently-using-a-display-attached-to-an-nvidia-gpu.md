A Graphics card or simply GPU is perhaps the most important component of any computer, be it a desktop or a laptop. Generally, only a selected range of laptops used to have a dedicated GPU; otherwise, they were better off with an integrated unit. However, times have changed, and newer laptops are increasing sporting dedicated graphics processing units (GPU) beside the integrated GPU. Similarly, desktop GPUs are also getting more and more powerful by the day.

The problem is that setting up a new computer with a dedicated GPU or upgrading your PC's hardware isn't always a smooth sail. Most of the time, you will encounter various software and hardware problems that require your immediate attention. Furthermore, sometimes the issues aren't even enlisted online, and you must solve them yourselves. So, you must consider yourself lucky if you only got the "you are not currently using a display attached to an Nvidia GPU" error, as it can be solved very easily; here's how:

## What Does it Mean?

In most cases, a single software error may refer to a number of different hardware and software problems. However, the real reason for this error depends on your situation. In this case, the error could mean that the Nvidia control panel couldn't detect your graphics card or that the monitor isn't plugged-in to the correct port. Moreover, sometimes it also means some sort of hardware damage, such as a damaged display port or a malfunctioning chip.

In any case, it is best to first diagnose the problem yourself before taking it out for repairs. However, if it is a case of hardware malfunction or damage, there isn't much that you can do about it. So, consider the hardware malfunction as your last resort, and try to fix the error using one of these methods.

## Reinstall the Driver

The most common reason for this error is that your display driver is corrupted or you installed the wrong version. Malware attacks and system crashes can cause the driver files to get corrupted or malfunction. So, if you recently experienced a system crash or your driver just stopped working out of the blue, then this fix is best for you.

* Visit the Nvidia Download center website.
* Search for your graphics card model from the drop-down menu.
* Download the latest driver and the control panel for your GPU.
* Open the control panel on your PC, and uninstall all components related to Nvidia.
* Alternatively, you can download the Nvidia Uninstaller from the official website to clean remove all traces of the driver.
* Once the uninstallation is finished, restart the PC from the power menu.
* After restart, run the freshly downloaded copy of the Nvidia control panel to reinstall all the components and the latest driver.
* Again, restart the PC to finish the installation, and check if the issue is fixed.

## Update the Driver

If you don't want to go through all this hassle and just want a quick software fix, then this method will work like a charm. Sometimes, the corrupted driver files prevent the panel from launching but don't prevent the update. As a result, Nvidia replaces the damaged files whenever you update the driver. There are two ways to update the driver, i.e., from the Windows Update and from the GeForce Experience.

* Even if you can't access the control panel, you can still open the GeForce Experience on your computer.
* Simply open the app and check for updates, and it will automatically download and install the latest version.
* If you are currently on the latest update, then click on reinstall the driver to reset the driver to factory settings.
* Alternatively, if you can't open the GeForce Experience app, you can update from the Windows Update Settings.
* Open Windows Settings, select Update & Security and check for updates.
* If no new updates are found, click on optional updates, and install the driver for Nvidia from there.
* Lastly, if you can't download from these methods and don't want a driver from Nvidia, you can always visit your laptop manufacturer to download an optimized driver package for your laptop.

## Check the Display Port

Another common reason for the "you are not currently using a display attached to an Nvidia GPU" error is when the monitor isn't properly connected to the GPU. As you know, your graphics card is the device that processes the visual data and displays it on the monitor. However, some PCs have two GPUs, i.e., integrated and dedicated GPU. So, when you try to access the monitor from the dedicated Nvidia GPU while it is connected to the integrated port, you get this error. Moreover, this mistake can sometimes lead to BSOD or a black screen.

* Turn off your computer and open the CPU case.
* Check whether the monitor's cable is connected to the integrated or dedicated GPU.
* If it is in the integrated port, switch it to your Nvidia GPU display port.
* Once you have performed the switch, make sure that the cable isn't loose.
* Turn on the computer and test.
* <Similarly, if the cable is already in the Nvidia port, remove it and check for any signs of damage.
* Reinsert the cable in the Nvidia port and turn on your computer for results.

## Check the Power Levels

The power supply is yet another factor that affects the workability of any computer. For instance, if any of the hardware is underpowered, it won't function correctly. So, if you recently did some overclocking, installed a new component, or replaced the PSU, it would be best to check the power levels for GPU. Furthermore, it is also best to calculate the power supply and demand when upgrading to a multi-GPU setup.

* Install a power software like MSI Afterburner and restart the PC.
* Check the system specifications for your graphics card from Techpowernup or Nvidia's official website.
* Alternatively, you can also check the specifications by installing GPU-Z on your PC.
* Once you know the voltage requirements of your card in Watts, open Afterburner and check the system resources.
* Similarly, MSI, Gigabyte, and Asus also offer built-in power management in the BIOS.
* If the allocated resources fall short of the power requirements, it is time to upgrade your power supply.
* The same is the case for the dual-GPU unit, as now you need to provide double the power.

## Do a hardware Reset

Have you ever heard of the term hardware reset? Well, it refers to disassembling, cleaning, and rebuilding your PC. In some cases, dust and other contaminants settle inside your PC. These contaminations often block the passage of electric current in various components, block the air vents, or even cause overheating. Therefore, it is important to clean your computer at least once every 2-3 months to avoid any mishaps.

Secondly, even if you service your computer regularly, chances are you didn't assemble it correctly. Most of the time, hardware might look connected, but it isn't locked properly in the cutouts, causing it to malfunction. Therefore, instead of trying every piece of hardware one by one, it is wise to remove everything, clean it up, and reinstall everything properly or, in other words, do a hardware reset.

While you are at it, another good idea is to replace the thermal paste of both CPU and GPU. In my opinion, the reset will fix almost every hardware issue that you may be facing due to improper connections or clogged vents. Furthermore, your PC will also become slightly faster as it now runs at a lower temperature.

## Last Resort

If none of these fixes worked for you, the chances are that your graphics card, monitor, or the cables are malfunctioning. That's all the diagnosis that you can do at home without any technical experience. Your last option is to take the computer to a professional service center where they will check the GPU, monitor, and connections for possible problems. Your worst-case scenarios are if the GPU is burnt, such as overheating, underpowering, overclocking, or short-circuiting. The professionals will then replace the damaged parts, fix the cause of the problem, and your PC will be as good as new in no time.

## Conclusion

Computer errors are common headaches for most people. Even if you just finished building your brand-new PC, the chances are that your Windows will welcome you with a few alien errors. "You Are Not Currently Using a Display Attached to an Nvidia GPU" is an error you can encounter after a new build, upgrade, or even after running the antivirus. Fortunately, you can easily fix the error as long as it isn't related to hardware malfunction or GPU failure. This article provides all the possible fixes for the error, and if you try them, you might also fix some other potential problems.
