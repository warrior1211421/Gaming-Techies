Everyone is interested in building a gaming PC at home these days. While it is a good idea to get the best gaming PC that you can afford, however, inexperience can come with some serious consequences. For instance, choosing the right motherboard that supports all your PC components is the most crucial step in any build: many times, people pre-order all the parts before choosing a motherboard. As a result, people end up replacing several parts because their motherboard’s BIOS wasn’t compatible with them.

In this regard, Gigabyte, Msi, and Asus are the largest manufacturers of motherboards in the world. If you follow the latest trends, you will most probably end up buying a motherboard from one of these brands. Therefore, it is important that you first understand the best option in Gigabyte Vs. MSI Vs. Asus Motherboards. More importantly, you must also consider the difference between their BIOS so that you can make the right decision.

## What is BIOS?

Basic Input/Output System or BIOS is the basic firmware responsible for starting the various PC components. It also provides some basic sets of instructions as to how much power to deliver to each part, which drivers to allocate, and how to boot into the operating system. In other words, your PC is a lifeless piece of hardware without a BIOS in it.

The BIOS is also responsible for making your computer compatible with newer hardware.

For example, you expect it to work faster when you upgrade the system processor from i5 to i7. Well, here’s the tricky part, your PC will not understand the new changes right away unless you update the BIOS. So, it won’t be wrong to say that the BIOS tells your PC about the hardware installed in various slots and their requirements.

## What is the Function of BIOS?

BIOS is responsible for putting life into your computer. It distributes the optimum amount of power among the various hardware components to turn them on. Moreover, the BIOS also keeps track of the computer state by running tests. So, it is a multifunctional system that ensures that your computer functions properly all the time. Some of the functions of BIOS are:

### Bootstrap Loader

The Bootstrap loader is responsible for allowing the computer to boot into different operating systems. For instance, if you change the boot mode from Legacy to UEFI, the system first runs a few checks to ensure that your system is compatible. The most important step is that your HDD or SSD’s partition table must be GPT for UEFI.

### BIOS Drivers

BIOS drivers are a unitary series of drivers that provide the bridge required for basic I/O hardware communication. Without these drivers, your PC won’t function, and you get the black screen of death problem. For instance, the BIOS drivers are responsible for telling the PC to turn on when you press the power button and so on.

### POST

Power-On Self-Test or POST is the self-evaluation system of any BIOS. Have you ever wondered how your PC knows that the fan isn’t working properly, the battery is dead, or the installed PSU isn’t sufficient?The POST performs various tests on the different PC components to ensure that all of them are working properly. Moreover, the PC can only boot into the operating system once it passes the POST stage.

### CMOS

Every motherboard, whether a PC or a laptop, has at least one CMOS battery. The CMOS chip is responsible for keeping your system alive even if you cut off the power supply. As a matter of fact, your PC’s BIOS remains active even after your cut off all sources of power.This battery helps in retaining the user data, hardware configuration, and other important instructions. 

## Top 3 Motherboards with the Best BIOS

By now, you must understand the importance of a powerful BIOS that suits your requirements. Generally, the BIOS comes pre-installed on the motherboard, and the only way to change it is through complex chip alteration. So, you are pretty much stuck with the company BIOS except for the time-to-time updates. Nowadays, tech-world giants like Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte offer the best and most user-friendly BIOS in their desktop and laptop motherboards. Here are the key factors that each of these brands has to offer in their products:

* **MSI:** Best BIOS for overclocking
* **Asus:** Best overall BIOS with automatic system optimization.
* **Gigabyte:** Best user-friendly and stable BIOS

### MSI BIOS

MSI BIOS is well-known as the best BIOS for system tweaking and overclocking. Their boards are optimized for the latest Intel and AMD processors, GPUs, and other hardware components. So, feel free to experiment with your PC to unlock its true potential. Moreover, the BIOS is GUI-based and offers different skins that you can customize from the settings. The BIOS’s feel is very similar to MSI Afterburner for most experts.

However, the BIOS isn’t all advanced and complex unless you need it. For inexperienced users, the motherboard also offers an EZ mode that still offers some room for experimentation and customization while keeping your system safe from mishaps. Moreover, you can always shift from the EZ mode to the advanced setup by switching the settings. Another benefit of the MSI BIOS is that it offers updates and recovery from USB, Lan, and HDD. So, even if you mess up a few times, you don’t always end up with a black screen of death. Overall, it is the perfect BIOS that provides complete freedom of optimization, overclocking, and tweaking to both experts and beginners.

#### Pros

### Asus BIOS

Asus provides the best BIOS system for both amateur and advanced users. Their Republic of Gamers or ROG motherboards has been ruling the laptop and desktop world for several years. The main reason is that, unlike MSI, Asus understands the user’s need to upgrade the PC over time. So, the BIOS automatically detects any hardware changes within a few seconds after startup and installs the updated BIOS drivers. Moreover, the system performance is automatically optimized according to the hardware without any user input.

Similarly, it is a user-friendly BIOS suitable for both experts and beginners. The latest BIOS update comes with the ROG-Pulse feedback. This update keeps a blinking logo even if the BIOS crashes so that you know it is time to recover. Furthermore, Asus is among the first brands to offer a smart erase feature, which cleans the SSD’s data and cache overtime to recover the speed and performance. Overall, it is a safe option for those who want to squeeze every drop of juice from their PC without messing it up.

#### Pros

* Extreme Tweaker
* Secure erase
* BIOS snapshot
* Auto CPU Level up
* GPU.DIMM 
* Easy system restores

### Gigabyte BIOS

Gigabyte has emerged as the safe haven for beginners and people who like to keep it simple yet optimized. Their motherboards come with a powerful yet simple BIOS setup that doesn’t confuse even the first-timers. For instance, it offers a simple and advanced mode depending on your requirements. Moreover, the BIOS also shows safe hardware optimization during tweaking. So, you will always know when it is time to stop overclocking to prevent hardware damage.

Secondly, the Gigabyte’s BIOS also offers several features that benefit the modders. For instance, the 3D mode allows you to access the system condition in real-time, providing details about which settings will affect what hardware. Moreover, you can choose either UEFI or Legacy mode depending on your drive’s partition table. Last but not least, the digital power feature is a masterpiece for the overclockers. This feature allows you to understand the power consumption of individual hardware so that you can maximize the system performance within safety limits.
