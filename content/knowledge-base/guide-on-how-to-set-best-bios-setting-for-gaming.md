faqs:
  - answer: BIOS is an abridged form of Basic Input/Output System. It is responsible
      for the computer's proper functioning by sending important instructions to
      it and maintaining the coordination between its components.
    question: What does BIOS stand for?
  - question: What is Best; BIOS or UEFI?
    answer: Both BIOS and UEFI are low-level software that gets started even before
      booting your computer's operating system to handle its various components
      beforehand. However, as BIOS is present in older motherboards, UEFI is
      considered the best modern times solution that can support larger drives,
      has faster boot timings, has extended security features, and comes with
      mouse and graphics cursors.
  - question: Is Updating BIOS Necessary?
    answer: Updating BIOS settings often is not necessary at all. But, installing a
      new version is more dangerous than updating the existing one. So, whenever
      you are in the process of updating your BIOS settings, and anything goes
      wrong, you can easily end up the process and keep your computer safe from
      any hazard.
  - question: Can BIOS Settings Make the Computer Slow?
    answer: Yes, it can. Usually, when it happens, your computer starts slowly at
      the initial stages of the startup process. This indicates the slower
      progress bar of the BIOS.
  - answer: It does not take so long. Usually, it takes almost a minute or two.
      However, if it takes more than 5 minutes, there will be greater chances to
      worry about any malfunction in your computer. This is because the BIOS
      comes in the sizes of almost 16-32 MB and has to write speeds of up to 100
      KB/s, so it should take an estimated time of about 10 MBPS or even lesser
      than that.
    question: How Long Does it Take to Update BIOS?

## What is BIOS, and How Does it Work

![What is BIOS, and How Does it Work](/uploads/what-is-bios.webp "What is BIOS, and How Does it Work")

[BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) refers to a computer system used by the CPU and is responsible for performing various startup procedures when you start the computer. It is a whole set of computer instructions that control all its output and input operations. It is a ROM chip that comes on the motherboard and allows you to easily access your computer's basic level settings.

It works professionally to keep your PC's basic operations working properly. It comes included with all the instructions relating to the loading of basic computer hardware. It has a test named as POST-Power-On Self-Test-that intelligently indicates whether your computer meets up all the requirements for the boot or not. If it does not meet them all, it starts up a beeping sound to indicate your computer's malfunctioning.

Furthermore, it activates all the other BIOS chips that are already present on different cards present in your computer-[graphics card](https://gamingtechies.com/best-gpu-for-ryzen-7-2700x/) or SCSI cards. It is also efficient in providing a productive set of some low-level routines that are responsible for managing keyboards, parallel ports, screen, and the serial in the process of your computer's booting.

## Why is BIOS Setting Important?

BIOS is crucial for any type of computer's operations, especially when it comes to gaming that needs a perfectly working PC at any cost. BIOS makes sure everything in your computer works properly through its POST test and provides instructions to the microprocessor to perform its general operations with perfection. In addition to this, it manages a wide range of settings for your PC's hard disk to help it store the data more effectively.

So, BIOS is very important as it makes sure your PC is working properly. It provides some useful default settings that are generally adequate for any type of gaming and business purposes. In addition to these, the BIOS setting are important for the following purposes.

### Loads the Operating System

After making sure that every component of your computer is working properly, it intelligently loads all the operating systems directly into the PC memory. This it does by reaching up to a code, also known as [Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record), from the boot drives to provide the computer with the instructions on properly loading the operating system. After the procedure, the computer gets totally ready to take over from BIOS, and it prepares to start loading the booting up and OS operations.

### Coordination Among Components

Furthermore, after helping the computer is booting up, BIOS provides some low-level drivers and various other details that are helpful in proper coordination of all the parts of the computer. It is responsible for passing on the message from one PC component to another and plays a vital role in the best coordination and perfect working of your computer to help you achieve the utmost satisfaction in your work.

### Computer Customization

Every computer comes pre-installed with the different types of BIOS settings to help it meet all your needs. However, depending upon your personal preference, you can change the BIOS setting for your PC.

This customization option is the best thing you get from any BIOS setting as it allows you to change various settings of your PC according to your own needs and choice. You can change the configuration options for [CPU clock speed](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/cpu-clock-speed.html) and also the voltage to make it run faster and better. You can also prevent anyone from stealing your personal data or bypassing your security; you can add a password to it and block everyone to reach the settings to change them.

## What are Different Types of BIOS Settings?

Depending upon the scope and function, BIOS has two types; UEFI BIOS and Legacy BIOS. Both of them work differently and are needed for different operations in the PC. Below is the detailed description for both of them.

Legacy BIOS: It also stands for the Basic Input Output System that is usually present on the older motherboards and is responsible for the computer's turning on and the basic coordination among different parts of the PC for its balanced functioning. However, it comes with certain limitations; they cannot recognize drives that are larger than 2.1 TB, and also, they come with text-only menus in their startup options.

**UEFI BIOS:** UEFI BIOS stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface BIOS, present in modern computers. It is capable of handling drives that are almost 2.2 TB or ever larger than these. It comes with the GUID Partition Table technique instead of the Master Boot Record to provide the computer with all the instructions.
