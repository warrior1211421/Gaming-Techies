Minecraft is perhaps the most beloved game for both young and classic gamers. The game was first pre-released for testing in 2009 and fully released in 2011. It has remained at the top of sandbox games since then. The game is available on all major PC and console OS. Moreover, the latest Microsoft Cross-platform feature allows you to use a single Microsoft Minecraft account on all your devices. However, most users face the Https://aka.ms Remoteconnect issue when signing in on their console. If you are one such user, I guarantee that this article will help you solve it.

## What is the Https://aka.ms Remoteconnect Problem?

The Remote connect problem is mainly faced by the console players. As mentioned earlier, Microsoft Cross-platform support allows you to use a single Minecraft account on all your devices. However, the feature is still new and has several bugs in it. So, what causes the problem?

### New Device

If you are using the Cross-platform feature for the first time, you will most likely be greeted with this error on the sign-in screen. It is because the game doesn’t allow multiple devices on a single account which contradicts the Cross-platform feature. So, if that is your case, don’t panic, as I will provide the complete solution in a while.

### Files Corruption

Modern consoles are programmed to generate autosave files after a while. This helps in keeping track of your game progress all the time. However, the game files may get corrupted for several reasons, including loss of power, improper shutdown, virus, and date/time settings. In that case, the game will start to malfunction and won’t let you sign in with your Microsoft account.

### Internet Connection

You need an active internet connection with no restrictions to access the sign-in page. However, if you have a faulty internet connection or the device isn’t connected to the internet at all, you will encounter several problems with your game. In this regard, the remote connect error will always be there to block your access.

### How to Fix it?

The fix to Https://aka.ms Remoteconnect problem depends on what’s causing it in the first place. By now, you should have fully understood the nature of your problem. So, it will be much easier for you to follow the step-by-step guide for your particular case.

**The New Device Issue**

* Download and install the latest version of Minecraft on your PS4/Nintendo Switch/Xbox console.
* Open the multiplayer access settings and note down the access code from the screen.

* Next, go to <https://aka.ms/remoteconnect> in a new tab and fill in the details like your Microsoft account and the Minecraft access code.

* Sign in to your Minecraft account and start a new game.

## Nintendo Switch

* Turn on the console and access the game menu.
* Navigate to the settings option and open it.
* Search for the Data Management option on the new screen and open it.

* If your Microsoft account sign-in were successful, you would see a box for the access code.
* Enter the code you noted from the Xbox to enable remote connect support.

### Setting up Remote Connect on PS4
