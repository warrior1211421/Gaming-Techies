Gaming is the biggest form of entertainment for most people and a profession for some. The rapidly growing gaming industry has triggered several changes in gaming accessories, especially the mouse and keyboards. For instance, modern gaming mice come with several buttons, various DPI settings, and special gaming tweaks. So, choosing the perfect mouse for your gaming style and optimizing the settings for each game can be a difficult job for most people. Moreover, some mice also feature shortcut keys to trigger different gaming profiles with one click. All these perks of modern gaming can easily confuse the inexperienced and newcomers.

Similarly, online multiplayer gaming is a whole different story for both professionals and gamers. For instance, playing multiplayer shooters like COD Warzone, Valorant, and PUBG requires the perfect balance of skill and hardware tweaking. Firstly, every gamer must fine-tune his monitor for the best resolution, quality, PPi, colors, and refresh rate. In this regard, a gaming mouse also requires fine-tuning for the perfect gaming experience. Mouse DPI is the first and most important thing that you must adjust according to your needs. So, What Mouse DPI Should you Use for FPS Gaming?

This article briefly explains the concept of DPI, its importance, and how you can tune it to boost your gaming performance.

## What is DPI?

DPI or dots per inch is the number of pixels that the cursor covers by physically moving the mouse one inch. In other words, you can cover the entire screen of your 1080 pixels monitor by using a 1000 DPI mouse. So, you can say that DPI is your mouse’s ability to quickly move from one spot to another with minimal physical movement.

The old 90s mouses had a maximum DPI of 800 or even less. On the contrary, the modern gaming mouses offer up to 16,000 DPI, and you can also adjust the DPI to meet your requirements. For example, you can use the maximum DPI if you need fast mouse movement for quickly switching between targets in fast-paced FPS. However, you can switch to lower DPI settings when sniping or playing RPGs.

## What Mouse DPI Should I Use for FPS Gaming?

Generally, it isn’t wise to use the same DPI settings for all games. The mouse’s DPI affects your speed and accuracy, and you can only choose one of them. For example, guns like Vandal in Valorant require fast reflexes to shoot at multiple targets, whereas OP and Marshal require lower DPIs to spot the enemy accurately. Similarly, you must tune the mouse settings depending on which game you play. Here are the best mouse DPI settings for various game genres:

| **Genre**                | **DPI**        |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| FPS/Shooter Game         | 1000 -1600     |
| MMORPG's                 | 1600 or Better |
| Real-time Strategy Games | 800 - 1200     |
| MOBA                     | 400 - 800      |



## Best DPI for Shooter Games

DPIs are usually the most beneficial for First-person shooters and competitive multiplayer shooter games. However, gamers have a misconception that the higher DPI, the better. In reality, you must tune your DPI settings to suit your gaming style. For example, you must use 400-600 DPI if you are a sniper, whereas assault rifles and pistols require 1000-1200 DPI. Furthermore, you can also use higher DPI settings if you game on large HD monitors at high resolutions.

## Best DPI for MMORPG Games

MMO and RPG games are the two most popular genres of multiplayer games after FPS. These games require even higher DPIs as you must quickly perform multiple operations. For example, when playing World of Warcraft and other similar games, you need to control different heroes to defeat your enemy. A typical mouse isn’t enough to keep up with your speed. So, you must use the highest DPI that your mouse can offer to get the upper hand over your enemies.

## Best DPI for Real-time Strategy Games

Real-time strategy games are very different from typical MMORPGs. These games require multiple operations, but you don’t need a lightning-fast cursor speed. So, you can save your budget by investing in a common gaming mouse. Generally, you need around 800 to 1200 DPI to balance speed and accuracy perfectly in these games. A higher DPI will often lead to misplaced clicks, failed strategies, and even defeat.

## Best DPI for MOBA Games

MOBA games have an active community of gamers who have been playing for several years. These games require accuracy, intelligence, and quick decisions to get the upper hand over your enemies. However, you don’t need a fast-moving cursor to play these games. For instance, the recommended DPI for MOBA games is between 400 to 800 DPI. So, you don’t need to spend on the high-end gaming mouses to enjoy games like DOTA 2 and League of Legends.

## Conclusion

Gaming is a rapidly growing industry that has surpassed the budget of the music and film industries. New players are regularly joining the ever-increasing gaming community. However, most newcomers are often confused about fine-tuning their PC hardware for the best gaming experience. In this regard, the most common question is what mouse DPI should I use for gaming?
