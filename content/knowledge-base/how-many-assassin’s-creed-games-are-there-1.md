Assassin’s Creed is probably one of the largest sagas with distinct characters in it. Every action-packed AC game has a complete story of its own. However, **[Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/)** has managed to connect the timelines, stories perfectly, and characters in each game. 

The best part is that you don’t have to play the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise to get a grip of the story. Unless you are an AC fanatic like me, in that case, you need to play all the games in their respective order, read their Wiki-Fandom pages, and explore the side stories in the Animus. So, **how many Assassin’s Creed games are there?** This article provides a detailed guide about all the current AC main story games in their respective order.

### Assassin’s Creed (2007)

The first Assassin’s Creed game features Desmond Miles as its main character. He wakes up in a lab where he meets with Dr. Vidic and his assistant. After some introduction about the Animus and a slight backstory, they force him to enter the machine. 

From there, the main story of Altair Ibn Lahad starts after a short tutorial. The first mission is about Altair and his companions stealing a mythic Piece of Eden and being attacked by Templars. After some action, the story then continues with another important character Al Mualim or the man of the mountain. It is a great game that provided the best graphics and dynamics of its time. In my opinion, the game surely deserves a remastered version with graphics enhancements.

### The Assassin’s Creed Trilogy (2009-2011)

Everyone who is a true AC fan loves Ezio Auditore more than any other character of the whole saga. The game series featured an enhanced graphics property renovation system and put you in the boots of an Assassin’s Creed leader. It is better known as the resurrection of the brotherhood. 

The main story is still played by the same character Desmond Miles, only now he works for the modern Assassin’s Brotherhood rather than the Abestergo company. Throughout the game, the character follows the footsteps of Altair to reclaim the lost piece of Eden and the library with all the important books. It is a game where you see Ezio grow from a teen to a master of the brotherhood. So, most players have more attachment with Ezio than any other character in the series.

### Assassin’s Creed III (2012)

**Assassin’s Creed III** is a modern AC game that further enhanced the gameplay experience and parkour. It is played by a different character whose ancestor was Connor, the son of Haitham Kenway. 

Throughout the game, Connor grows from a mere tribe member of native Americans to a full-fledge Assassin under his mentor. He seeks revenge from his father, who uses Connor’s mother to gain access to another piece of Eden. The game proved to be a pathway for all the upcoming Assassin’s Creed games in the franchise.

### Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag (2013)

**Assassin’s Creed IV** saw several performances and parkour improvements. Moreover, it is a pirate-based game that features both land and sea combat throughout the story. It is the second most popular AC game after the Ezio Trilogy. 

The shanties from this game are so realistic and mesmerizing that most players remember at least two of them. The Animus also received a new major upgrade in this AC game that featured a whole new menu and hacking system. The Dynamics and upgrades from the AC IV remain the same all the way to Assassin’s Creed Unity.

### Assassin’s Creed Syndicate (2015)

**AC Syndicate** was a major breakthrough after the negative review of AC Unity. It made up with all the disappointed fans with the new Victorian-style gameplay that completely absorbs you in the gameplay. You now control two characters, Jack and Eve, two siblings who free Victorian London from gangs and the ever-powerful Order of the Templars. It is the most modern Era portrayed in any AC game inside the Animus. 

The game featured a whole new combat system, building renovations, and several Animus upgrades. From here, the story leaps back in time to show the real origins of the Assassins Brotherhood.

### Assassin’s Creed Origins & Odyssey (2017-2018)

Everyone thought that Ezio resurrected the brotherhood after the death of Altair. However, the common fans didn’t understand the real origins of the brotherhood. Therefore, Ubisoft developed two games that showed the real origins of the brotherhood when it had no name. 

AC Origins takes you on a trip to Ancient Egypt, where you meet Bayek and his son Khemu. Bayek seeks revenge from a group of masked templars who force him to open a secret vault, and kill his son after receiving a mysterious artifact.

Similarly, in AC Odyssey, the time period shifts to the battle of Thermopylae between Spartans and the Persian Empire. So, both the games portray the early days of the brotherhood while revealing some ancient secrets along the way.

### So, What is the Animus?

The Animus is a device developed by modern Templars, the Abstergo company. The device can unlock the memory of anyone’s ancestors from their DNA. They use this memory to trace back the footsteps of early Assassins to retrieve the missing pieces of Eden.

## Conclusion

**Assassin’s Creed** is the largest action-packed saga with up to **12 main story games** and several side-story versions. It portrays important world events in the light of a fight between the Assassins Brotherhood and the Order of the Templars. Both the parties try to maintain world peace but with different pathways. So, if you are a fan of history and conspiracy theories, the Assassin’s Creed franchise will keep you entertained for several months.
